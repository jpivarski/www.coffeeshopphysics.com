<h2>Talks I have presented</h2>

<p>I put this page together to provide access to the conceptual graphics that I've used in presentations.  Unfortunately for you, I don't always explain what you're looking at on the slide because its purpose is to have something to point at while I'm speaking.  Too many words would get in the way.  If you want to use some graphics but need to understand the source or what it means, please <a href="mailto:jpivarski@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>.

<p>Some of these talks are general enough for any audience, while others are intended for professional physicists.  They're all what I would consider major talks, whether for outreach or for conferences.  (My complete list of talks averages one per week over a period of five years.)  I also can't include any &ldquo;internal&rdquo; talks, presented within a scientific collaboration, since their content is considered provisional.  Most of them wouldn't be interesting to many people, anyway.

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://eddata.fnal.gov/lasso/program_search/show_specialEvent_title.lasso?title=Ask">Fermilab Ask-a-Scientist</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> the general public</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">This talk has a lot of conceptual graphics that would be good for other talks, blogs, etc.  I might use some of them in a future <i>Coffeeshop Physics</i> post.</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">The dark matter section is pretty standard, except that I go through the whole argument about how alternatives to the current WIMP idea were ruled out (or mostly ruled out).</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">The dark energy section is really an extension of my <a href="/articles/2011-08/13_a_stitch_in_time/">Stitch in Time</a> (pants) article.</div>

<h2 class="talktitle"><a href="2011-12-08_CMU_undergrad_colloquium.pdf">Why do we need a Higgs Boson?</a></h2>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</span> December 8, 2011</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/physics/">CMU</a> Undergraduate Colloquium</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> junior and senior physics majors</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">Physics undergrads are an interesting audience: they know enough to learn the technical details of a cutting-edge physics topic, but they usually don't know anything about the topic itself.  This talk provides a semi-technical introduction to quantum field theory and the Higgs mechanism (both are grad school topics).</div>

<div class="stuffaboutit">I gave a talk based on the <a href="/articles/2011-08/13_a_stitch_in_time/">pants article</a> at Villains Bar &amp; Grill.  It was late at night and the audience was getting drowsy, so I demonstrated gravity by jumping around a lot.  The talk had a few new graphics, like the one shown here.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/orgs/fermilab_users_org/meeting/">Fermilab Users' Meeting</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> professional particle physicists</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">A signature-based overview of the first year of CMS (LHC) exotica results.  ("Exotica" is how physicists describe the &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo; category of searches.  Some, but not all of this is out of date: see the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResults">CMS public results page</a> for updates.)</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</span> October 29, 2010</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="https://www.usluo.org/">U.S. LHC Users' Meeting</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> professional particle physicists</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">A review of the first year of CMS results.  The &ldquo;Rediscovering the Standard Model&rdquo; slide was very popular; a lot of physicists used it elsewhere.</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">Everyone in the audience was a physicist working on the LHC experiments.  After all the hard work, I wanted to encourage them to take a look back and see where we were: naysayers predicted that it would take years to get from first beams to well-calibrated results, but even the complex techniques were well executed.  That's why the talk has as much historical context as it does: to remind us what we were hearing and thinking just one year earlier.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://quarknet.fnal.gov/">Fermilab QuarkNet</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> high-school students</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">One of my first outreach talks: two groups of high school students were visiting Fermilab&mdash; one American, the other Japanese.  (That's why the Standard Model table is in Japanese, just for fun.)</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">It uses a chess-set metaphor throughout.  I should use that metaphor again.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/">American Physical Society, Division of Particles and Fields</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> professional particle physicists</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">My main work on CMS (one of the LHC experiments) was on the alignment of detectors designed to identify muons.  This summarizes that work to physicists in other fields.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/index.php/78-cafe-pages/229-collage-station">Caf&eacute; Scientifque</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> the general public</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">This was a casual talk in a bar in Bryan, Texas.  The LHC was all over the news at this point, so I wanted to put it into context: to get away from the &ldquo;end of the world&rdquo; stuff and explain why scientists want to do the experiment in the first place.  To keep it informal, I wasn't allowed to use any presentation materials (slides), so I talked with my hands.  From the pictures, I seem to be picking up individual protons and tossing them around.  The &ldquo;slides&rdquo; stored here are the lecture notes and photos.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~mctp/SciPrgPgs/events/2009/LHC/index.html">LHC and Dark Matter Workshop</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> professional particle physicists</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">I wanted to learn more about dark matter, so I attended a workshop on the connections between dark matter and the LHC.  This talk is an overview of what the first year of CMS data-taking <i>would be like,</i> because it hadn't happened yet.  The data plots are all simulations.</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">At this conference, I learned about the theoretical possibility of leptonic jets, which I searched for when the data became available.  We didn't find any.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> <a href="http://www.phy.syr.edu/~lhcb/public/alignment/LHCAlignmentWorkshop/">LHC Alignment Workshop</a></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> experts in detector alignment</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">This one is very technical.  The slide on the right shows an early stage of the detector (MTCC): only the chambers colored red had been installed at the time the data were taken (cosmic rays).</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</span> May 10, 2007</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Venue:</span> Riemannian geometry study group</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> four math and physics postdocs and student</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">At Texas A&amp;M, a group of four of postdocs and one graduate student arranged an informal class to teach ourselves about Riemannian geometry (curvature of surfaces and curvature of spaces).  When I was at Cornell, we used to do informal classes a lot.  I didn't contribute much to teaching that semester, so I made up for slacking with a single big lecture on spatial curvature in physics (real life).</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">This shows the mathematics behind the &ldquo;universe as a shape&rdquo; pictures I made in my March 2012 general-audience talk, as well as some primative early visualizations.</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> professional particle physicists</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">Just a couple of months after my Ph.D., a fellow collaborator on the CLEO experiment asked me to give a talk at CMU (where I was an undergraduate, coincidentally).  This is almost entirely about my thesis, though I put it in a wider context.</div>

<div class="stuffaboutit">When I was a physics grad student at Cornell, I sometimes attended the math grad students' seminars, and on a few occasions, gave a talk.  They were chalkboard talks, so no slides.  I still have some notes, though...
<ul>
   <li>November 29, 2005: <b>Why Stuff is Hard</b>.  Quantum field theory describes matter as diffuse clouds of probability&mdash; why, then, are rocks and hard things tangible?  This is a question that bothered me, so I did some research and found a semi-satisfying answer.  Some of this work appears in the December 2011 CMU colloquium and two <i>Everything Seminar</i> blog posts: <a href="http://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/why-stuff-is-hard/">Why Stuff is Hard</a> and <a href="http://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/why-everything-is-hard/">Why Everything is Hard</a>.</li>
   <li>March 30, 2004: <b>Bell's inequality: the spookiest thing about quantum mechanics</b>.  A mixture of chalkboard, transparencies, and some props to help convey the geometry of the experiment.</li>
   <li>October 21, 2003: <b>Approximating everything</b>.  Big bang cosmology as a simple calculus problem.  (Get it, &ldquo;everything?&rdquo;)</li>

<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audience:</span> mathematicians who might be interested in physics</div>
<div class="stuffaboutit">I was actually just a guest-blogger, and the blog was originally intended for cute math problems to interest research-level mathematicians.  But it's a lot of work to produce articles like that, and the seminar-style posts gradually tapered off.  Meanwhile, the LHC was starting up, and I filled the void with my news reports of how things were going.<br><br>These posts are in reverse order: latest to earliest.

It bugged me.  What I was saying wasn't different in substance from the CERN reports (in fact, I was largely relying on the CERN reports; I ignored the rumors).  I did use different terms, though&mdash; instead of phrases like &ldquo;rapid release of pressure in which large forces were involved&rdquo; I used the E-word, &ldquo;explosion.&rdquo;  That was my introduction to the perils of P.R.</li>
