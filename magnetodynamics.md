<h3>Tabletop Experiments</h3>

<p>The web applet above demonstrates many features of the
  Magnetodynamics package for
  the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity game engine</a>.
  Magnetodynamics adds magnetic forces and fields to Unity's physics
  simulation.</p>

<p>The applet takes a few seconds to load if you have the Unity web
  player.  If not, <a href="http://unity3d.com/webplayer/">click
  here</a> to download the plugin.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>Most of the objects on the table can be moved with the mouse.  Some
are permanent magnets and some are attracted by magnets.  You can put
the magnets on the refrigerator, twist the green field lines, and bend
the stream of accelerated particles.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>Magnetodynamics contains GameObjects representing magnetic dipoles,
magnetizable materials, solenoid fields, and streams of
charged particles.  You can simulate many of the most visible aspects
of magnetism and static electricity this way.  See the documentation
for all of the details, and click below for more examples.</p>
