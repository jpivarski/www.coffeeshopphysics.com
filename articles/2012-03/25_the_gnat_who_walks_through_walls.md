<p>Imagine being invisible: what would that mean, physically?  None of
  the skin, muscles, or bones in your body could absorb light in any
  way, including your eyes.  Vision works because light is absorbed on
  the backs of your eyes, so to be invisible, you would also need to
  be blind.

<p>Now imagine being intangible as well, imagine matter could pass
  through you as light does.  You'd probably drop through the floor
  and orbit the center of the Earth like a yo-yo--- that is, if you
  were insensitive to all forces except gravity.  Take away gravity
  and there would be nothing left to tie you to this world.  When
  light, matter, and gravity are not communicating with something, it
  might as well be in a separate universe.  The extent of the physical
  world is defined by the interactions that connect our senses to
  phenomena: if something is truly undetectable, does it even make
  sense to say it exists?

<p>Neutrinos inhabit a world that is almost, but not quite,
  disconnected from our own.  They are insensitive to
  electromagnetism, the force that makes things visible and tangible,
  as well as the nuclear strong force that holds nuclei together in
  atoms.  They ought to feel gravity but have so little mass that this
  has never been proven.  We only know they exist because of their
  involvement in the weak nuclear force, which governs some but not
  all radioactive decays.

<p>The picture above is the Earth--- as seen in neutrinos.
  Neutrinos are emitted by uranium products in the Earth's crust, but
  then pass pass through the Earth as though it were a soap bubble.
  The bright spots are new: they are nuclear power plants.  To a
  weakly-interacting being who only sees neutrinos, nuclear reactors
  and atom smashers are the only evidence of life on Earth.

<p><b>Little Neutrinos</b>

<p>The idea of neutrinos started as a joke.  ``Dear Radioactive Ladies
  and Gentlemen,'' Wolfgang Pauli wrote to a 1930 convention in
  T&uuml;bingen, ``I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save
  the law of conservation of energy.''  Certain radioactive decays
  seemed to be missing energy when all visible particles were
  accounted for.  Pauli proposed that the missing energy was spirited
  away by an invisible particle, ``but I dare not publish anything
  about this idea.''  He then apologized for missing the meeting, as
  he was indispensable at a ball in Z&uuml;rich.

<p>Enrico Fermi took the idea and developed it into a complete theory
  of the weak interaction.  He would have called this neutral particle
  a <i>neutrone,</i> but the word was already taken by a much more
  massive particle.  Instead he called it ``a little <i>neutrino</i>''
  with a pinch between the thumb and forefinger.

<p>For twenty years, neutrinos were purely theoretical because they
  are so hard to detect.  You have to build giant detectors and wait
  for one of the trillions of neutrinos passing through it each second
  to interact, causing a single atom to transmute (change from one
  kind of atom to another, like chlorine into argon).  Neutrino
  detectors are usually room- or building-sized and are deep
  underground to protect them from the cosmic rays and other naturally
  occurring radiation that would transmute atoms much more easily.

<p>Neutrinos are so inaccessible that their basic parameters are still
  not well known.  They have mass, but not much and nobody knows how
  much.  They come in at least three ``flavors,'' though there have
  been unconfirmed hints of a fourth.  Like all other kinds of matter,
  they have an antimatter counterpart (antineutrinos), but unlike the
  others, there have been unconfirmed hints that antineutrinos have a
  different mass than neutrinos.  Last year, an experiment seemed to
  show that some neutrinos travel faster than light.  Though the
  result (now withdrawn) was met with skepticism, it got a lot more
  traction than it would have if it had not been about neutrinos.
  Physicists openly admit that they don't much about this elusive
  particle.

<p><b>Flavor Changes and Quantum Mechanics</b>

<p>I was still in college when it was first discovered that neutrinos
  spontaneously change from one flavor into another.  All the 
  professors in the physics department took Lincoln Wolfenstein out to
  lunch because this was (in part) his solution to the mystery of why
  we see fewer neutrinos from the sun than we expect.  On their
  eight-minute journey to the Earth, about two-thirds of the neutrinos
  change flavors and seem to disappear in experiments that are
  sensitive to one flavor and not the others.

<p>Neutrino flavors are defined by the reactions they participate in.
  Reactions involving electrons produce or consume electron-neutrinos,
  reactions with muons involve muon-neutrinos, and reactions with tau
  particle involve tau-neutrinos.  For example, a nucleus can
  sometimes eat its innermost-orbiting electron, and when one of its
  protons uses it to transform into a neutron, it spits out an
  electron-neutrino, never a muon-neutrino or a tau-neutrino.
  Electrons, muons, and taus are very similar particles, differing
  only in mass.  For unknown reasons, nature decided to have three
  electron-like particles and a neutrino for each of them.

<p>Though flavor is a meaningful label for neutrinos traveling short
  distances, neutrinos lose their flavor-identity when they travel
  long distances.  Electron-antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor
  are still electron antineutrinos when measured in a detector less
  than a mile or so from the reactor.  But most of the
  electron-neutrinos created in the sun become muon-neutrinos and
  tau-neutrinos on their way here: Earth-bound detectors find all three
  flavors, but a detector placed on the surface of the sun would see
  electron-neutrinos and little else (before it vaporized).

<p>These neutrino transformations are a quantum mechanical effect,
  perhaps the largest quantum states ever seen.  Quantum mechanics is
  usually only relevant for microscopic processes, like the energy of
  an electron orbiting an atom.  A famous thought-experiment used to
  describe it is Schr&ouml;dinger's cat: a cat sleeps in an impervious
  box with a quantum measuring device attached to a vial of poison.
  If the device registers a certain value, it releases the poison and
  kills the cat.  A quantum system can truly have multiple values
  for a parameter at the same time, such as an electron in two places
  at once or a light wave made of exactly five photons and also
  exactly ten photons.  When measured, the quantum system randomly
  chooses to become one of the possibilities it had been considering.
  If nothing inside the box can be observed, the thinking went, the
  superimposed realities would carry through to the measuring device,
  the poison, and the cat.  The cat would be both alive and dead, not
  one or the other.

<p>This sort of thing doesn't really happen with cats.  Superimposed quantum
  states are delicate: though easy to produce on a microscopic scale,
  they quickly collapse (choose one possible value) when amplified to
  anything as large as a detector needle.  If you were to try to build
  a real Schr&ouml;dinger's cat experiment, approximately half of your
  cats would be dead (unless you re-use cats), but none of them would
  be half-alive, half-dead.  Quantum systems collapse whether anyone
  is looking at them or not, so making the box more impervious
  wouldn't change anything but the epistemological question of how you
  can know if you don't look.  Though the collapse (or
  ``decoherence'') of quantum systems is still not fully understood,
  the process seems to have something to do with the number of
  interactions.  Isolated quantum systems maintain their concurrent
  realities, but systems pestered by frequent interactions from
  outside collapse to a single reality.

<p>Few particles are as unharassed as neutrinos.  Between a
  neutrino's birth in the sun and its death in a detector, it
  interacts far less than an electron does when it jumps from your
  hand to a doorknob.  For 93 million miles, the neutrino is in a womb
  of perfect isolation.

<p>When a quantum system collapses, one variable describing it becomes
  single-valued while another becomes multivalued.  (Sometimes people
  say ``uncertain'' instead of ``multivalued,'' but the latter is a
  better word.)  The famous example is the duality between an
  electron's position and its momentum (speed).   Many simultaneous
  positions narrow to a single point in space as your
  position-measuring device interacts with it.  But the same bath of
  interactions makes its momentum multivalued.  Similarly, a wave-like
  light beam with a single-valued intensity can become a stream of a
  definite number of particles, depending on how you treat it, but not
  both.  When a quantum system collapses, it doesn't become
  non-quantum, it just chooses one way of being quantized over
  another.

<p>Flavor and mass are the yin and yang of neutrinos.  When a neutrino
  has a single flavor, it has three simultaneous masses, and when it
  has a single mass, it has three flavors.  The production and decay
  of the neutrino are interactions that force a definite flavor: the
  sun makes electron-neutrinos and not muon-neutrinos or tau-neutrinos
  because it's full of electrons, not muons or taus.  (The sun is not
  hot enough to make muons and taus.)  When a neutrino is destroyed by
  a reaction in an Earth-bound detector, the reaction can produce an
  electron, a muon, or a tau, but not more than one.  Because the
  signals for these reactions look different, the quantum system
  collapses to only one at a time.

<p>In transit, there are no demands on a neutrino's flavor, but the
  mass becomes more definite.  All particles acquire a more
  sharply defined mass as they fly away from an interaction, though
  the effect is most apparent for particles with ultrabrief lives.
  Particles living longer than a few yoctoseconds (a yoctosecond is a trillionth of a trillionth of a second) in a typical
  collider experiment have a single-valued mass within experimental
  resolution, while particles that die within a yoctosecond or less do
  not have time to choose a single mass.  In the experiment, their
  mass appears as a smear that is wider than experimental resolution.

<p><b>The Colors of Neutrino Mixing</b>

  uncertainty ranges, cut off at 95% confidence.  Last
  summer's MINOS and T2K results were marginally inconsistent with
  zero (``hints''), but the Daya Bay measurement is clearly
  non-zero.  They're also all consistent with one another.</div>
</div>

<p>The duality between neutrino flavors and neutrino masses is what
  makes it possible for them to undergo a net change in flavor between the sun
  and the Earth.  As the neutrino's mass becomes single-valued, its
  flavor becomes triple-valued, and when it interacts, it randomly
  chooses one of those three flavors.  That was a new discovery about a
  decade ago when I was in college.  As of this month, we now know how
  much of each flavor is in each mass state.
  The <a href="http://theta13.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/">Daya Bay
  experiment</a> in China finally discovered the third and last mixing
  ratio (assuming there isn't a fourth neutrino!).
  The <a href="http://legacy.kek.jp/intra-e/press/2011/J-PARC_T2Kneutrino.html">T2K
  experiment</a> in Japan
  and <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2011/06/24/fermilab-experiment-weighs-in-on-neutrino-mystery/">MINOS</a>
  at Fermilab saw hints of this quantity last year, but not with
  enough certainty to claim a discovery.

<p>The three neutrinos labeled by states of definite mass
  &nu;<sub>1</sub>, &nu;<sub>2</sub>, and &nu;<sub>3</sub> have the
  following mixtures of electron-neutrinos (&nu;<sub>e</sub>),
  muon-neutrinos (&nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>), and tau-neutrinos
  (&nu;<sub>&tau;</sub>):

<center><table>
<tr><td align="right">&nu;<sub>1</sub></td><td width="40px" align="center">is</td><td align="right">82% &nu;<sub>e</sub>,</td><td align="right">&minus;44% &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>,</td><td align="right">37% &nu;<sub>&tau;</sub></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">&nu;<sub>2</sub></td><td width="40px" align="center">is</td><td align="right">55% &nu;<sub>e</sub>,</td><td align="right">63% &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>,</td><td align="right">&minus;55% &nu;<sub>&tau;</sub></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">&nu;<sub>3</sub></td><td width="40px" align="center">is</td><td align="right">15% &nu;<sub>e</sub>,</td><td align="right">64% &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>,</td><td align="right">75% &nu;<sub>&tau;</sub></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>The exact numbers may change as measurements get more precise, but
  for the first time, none of them need to be left blank for lack of
  knowledge.

<p>These numbers can be presented visually as a combination of
  colors.  Suppose that &nu;<sub>e</sub>, &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>, and
  &nu;<sub>&tau;</sub> are red, green, and blue in a color palette.
  Each mass state would be a mixture of primary colors, like this:

<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="neutrinos.png" alt="Neutrino flavor/mass mixtures, represented by colors.">
</div></div>

<p>(Since some of the fractions are negative, I've chosen to represent
  zero as the grey halfway between black and white.  Negative
  contributions are darker than
  half-grey.  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2906">This paper</a>
  was helpful.)

<p>The mixtures are partly a
  rotation around the central point, but in the three dimensions of
  red, green, and blue.  The new measurement from Daya Bay mostly
  accounts for the redness of &nu;<sub>3</sub>, which is slight.
  That's why it was so hard to measure.

<p>Neutrinos are not the only particles known to mix like this, but
  theirs is the most vigorous mixture.  Three flavors of quarks,
  ``down,'' ``strange,'' and ``beauty,'' mix in the same sort of way.
  Though they have much shorter lives than neutrinos, these quarks
  spontaneously change flavor as they fly away from the collisions
  that created them.  Their mixing looks like this:

<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="quarks.png" alt="Quark flavor/mass mixtures, represented by colors.">
</div></div>

<p>Notice that the mass states are barely any different from the
  flavor states, though there is a slight rotation.  I've added
  guidelines to help you see it.  There is so little difference that
  physicists don't usually make a verbal distinction between beauty
  (by mass) and beauty (by flavor), as I'm doing with the block
  letters and cursive in the picture.  Nobody knows why the quark mass
  and flavor states are so neatly aligned while the neutrino states
  are so wild.  Nature may be trying to tell us something.

<p><b>The Imaginary Part of the Mixture</b>

<p>In making these pictures, I've only had to sweep one fact under the
  rug.  The proportions of flavor states in the mass states are
  complex numbers
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">see
  Wikipedia</a> for more about complex numbers).  Since I can't mix complex
  fractions of red, green, and blue, I've assumed that the imaginary
  part of the mixing is zero.  While this assumption is probably
  false, it's still possible because the imaginary part hasn't been
  measured yet.

<p>However, this number I ignored might explain why we all exist.
  In the early universe, a slight difference arose somehow between
  the amount of matter and the amount of antimatter in the primordial
  soup.  As the universe expanded and cooled, particles and
  antiparticles annihilated one another and were not replaced by new
  particle-antiparticle pairs from the ambient heat.  If the matter
  and antimatter were exactly balanced, they would have completely
  annihilated, leaving nothing but an afterglow.  Instead, the matter
  and antimatter almost exactly balanced, leaving mostly afterglow and
  a smidgen of matter.  That's us: all the stars and galaxies in the
  universe are the crumbs of a primeval feast.

<p>Thirteen billion years later, we're wondering how we survived.  A
  slight difference between the laws governing matter and the laws
  governing antimatter could explain the imbalance, and the imaginary
  part of a flavor/mass mixing would provide such a difference.  This
  motivated many careful measurements of quark mixing fractions, and
  the result of all that hard work is that we now know that quark
  mixing is too small to explain the primordial
  matter-antimatter asymmetry.  Since the imaginary part of neutrino mixing
  is still unknown, one wonders if it was the neutrinos that tipped the scales.

<p>Wouldn't it be funny if our material world owes its existence to a
  particle that's barely even here?  Its imaginary fraction, no less?
