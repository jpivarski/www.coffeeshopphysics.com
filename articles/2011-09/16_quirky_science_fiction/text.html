<p>I like old science fiction.  The stories from the first half of the
twentieth century didn't always get the science right, but they
incorporated a lot of the latest ideas of their time.  For
example, <i>When Worlds Collide,</i> a 1934 novel about the Earth
colliding with a roving exoplanet, had this description of the rocket
that would save a remnant of humanity:

<p>``Each of these tubes generates the rays that split atoms of beryllium
into their protons and nuclei.  The forces engendered in the process,
which is like a molecular explosion, but vastly greater, together with
the disrupted matter, is then discharged through this gun...''

<p>Splitting atoms?  Vast forces?  They're talking about nuclear energy
ten years before the world knew about the atom bomb.  But more
surprisingly, the authors knew that beryllium might be a good atom to
do it.  Leó Szilárd's secret patent two years later was based on the
idea that beryllium or uranium might start a chain reaction---
beryllium didn't work, but uranium did.

<p>Why did the authors, Balmer and Wylie, think that beryllium might be a
good ingredient for a nuclear rocket?  At the time, beryllium was used
as a neutron source, and neutrons were known to increase the
radioactivity of normal matter--- but the neutron had only been
discovered three years prior.  Did they read scientific journals?
Were these ideas ``in the air,'' known to a literate public?

<p>Today's science fiction usually doesn't follow science this closely.
Much of what I find in the modern stories is based on scientific ideas
or discoveries that are at least fifty years old, like wormholes,
antimatter, and parallel universes.  If telepathy was ever considered
scientific, then it was in the hyper-empirical environment of the
1920's and 30's, yet mind-readers are still ubiquitous in sci-fi.  Did
the science in science fiction congeal half a century ago?

<p>In this article, I'm going to take a very recent theoretical idea and
imagine what could happen if it were true.  The borders of our
knowledge are surrounded by dragons--- anything that is not excluded
by experimental data <i>might</i> exist, and can be taken seriously
until proven otherwise.  Thousands of theoretical papers postulate new
laws of physics that could be discovered or refuted by the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and other experiments.  We group them into
categories: Higgs and Higgs-like particles, the many variants of
supersymmetry, extra dimensions (warped, universal, or large), and a
potpourri called ``exotica.''  This one is definitely exotica.

<p>The idea is that among the massive particles that are only found in
the aftermath of violent collisions, there might be giant quarks,
called quirks.  This is a bit like saying that we know that lizards
exist, and we know that giants exist (elephants, whales), so why not
giant lizards?  Tokyo is doomed!  And in fact, giant lizards are
possible--- dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Quirks (with an ``i'') are
imagined to be ten or a hundred thousand times heavier than the
lightest quarks.  The top quark (with an ``a'') is known to be 35
thousand times heavier than the lightest quarks, so it's not at all
impossible.  The difference is that quirks would not decay immediately
(as top quarks do) and would have their own quark-like force.  It
would be an isolated sector, similar to known particles, but unrelated
to them.

<p>Before talking about quirks, I need to explain what we know about
quarks, a bit like a discourse on the humble ant before getting to the
giant raging monster ants that are attacking the city.  Quarks are
attracted to each other by a very strong and sticky force.  By
``sticky,'' I mean that the particles that cause the attraction
between quarks are themselves attracted by this force.  There is no
analogue in our everyday world.  The electric force that attracts hair
to balloons is made of force-particles called photons, and photons
don't care about other photons--- they just fly through each other.
The quark-force particles, called gluons, veer toward other gluons.

<p>The lines of electric force between two oppositely charged particles
(e.g. hair and balloon) look like the picture on the left.  The lines
of gluonic force between two quarks look like the picture on the
right.

</div></div>

<p>If we pull two charged particles away from each other, the lines of
  electric force
spread out and the force gets weaker.  If we pull two quarks away from
each other, the lines don't spread out because the gluons draw
themselves into a tight bundle.

<div><img src="field_lines_2.png" alt="Electric and gluonic field lines, slightly farther apart"></div>
</div></div>

<p>The force between the quarks doesn't weaken with distance.  It
approaches a constant--- approximately 14 tons.  If we could separate
the quarks by a distance large enough to see, they would have some
amazing properties.  But sadly, the tube breaks while the quarks are
still within a millionth of a millionth of an inch.  As the tube
stretches, it accumulates enough energy to create two new quarks,
which become the new endpoints of the tube.

<div><img src="field_lines_4.png" alt="Gluonic field lines, after splitting"></div>
</div></div>

<p>Here is how quirks differ: because quirks are so massive, it would
take a lot more energy to create a new pair of them to break the
tube.  And since they're hypothetical anyway, we can imagine that the
quirk-force is weaker and puts less strain on the tube, too.  (It's a
free parameter--- it could have any value that hasn't been ruled out.)
There could be pairs of quirks flying out of the LHC right now,
connected by subatomic rubber bands, spinning around each other like
cannon balls tied by a chain.  I say, ``could be'' because this
particular theory has not been tested against LHC data, yet.

</div></div>

<p>If the quirks, like quarks, are electrically charged, then we would
see their trajectories in the detectors, looping around like a
double-helix.  Moreover, one of the quirks might even slow down and
get lodged in a chunk of matter like the detector wall.  If the other
end of the tube is free, it would spiral around the fixed end until it
loses enough energy to get stuck somewhere else.  Then we would have a
subatomic rubber band connecting two pieces of equipment.

<p>One of the conditions of the quirk theory is that normal matter does
not respond to the new quirk-force, only quirks do.  Therefore,
these tubes would pass right through normal matter like a ghost.
(That's not new: neutrinos do that, too, for the same reason.)
Imagine what would happen if we got opposite ends of a lot of quirk
strings lodged in two separate chunks of matter: the quirks are stuck
to the normal matter because of their electric charge, and they are
stuck to each other by the quirk-force.  Thus, the normal matter would
be bound together by this exotic force--- imagine bridges in which we
could walk through the supports or cranes whose cables can pass
through buildings.

<p>To get a crane that can lift a living-room couch from outdoors, we have
assumed that the tubes can stretch many feet without breaking.
Suppose that's not true.  If the parameters are such that they break
when they're a thousandth or a millionth of an inch long--- much longer
than subatomic scales but much shorter than human scales--- they wouldn't
be useful for architecture.  They would, however, be useful for
materials science.  Imagine a material that has been infused with
quirks: a spiderweb of quirk pairs stretched across its atomic
lattice.  If we try to rip the material apart, not only would the
normal atomic and molecular bonds resist the ripping, but so would the
quirk pairs.  If we pull hard enough, the quirk-tubes would break by
forming new quirks--- enriching the material even more.  As we pull harder
and harder, all of our effort would only create a denser and denser
network of rubber bands, bracing the material more strongly than
ever.  Quirks would become the universal hardener--- we could add them
to any material to make it invincible.

<p>Suppose that this sort of quirk is discovered with a mass of 1 TeV,
which is the mass of a thousand protons.  The energy needed to break a
force-tube between two of them is twice the quirk mass, 2 TeV = 0.3
microjoules.  If it breaks when it's a thousandth of an inch long,
then the average force they exert is work-divided-by-displacement = 13
millinewtons per pair.  That's not much force per pair, but the act of
ripping them apart doubles the number of pairs.  A thousand quirk
pairs exert 13 newtons of force, which is 3 pounds, a million quirk
pairs exert 1.4 tons, and 10 billion quirk pairs in a kilogram of
meter-long material would be strong enough to build a space elevator.
The quirk pairs double and redouble until we just can't pull any
harder.

<p>Hardening a material in this way wouldn't change its compressibility,
since quirks don't mind getting closer to each other.  And it would
only harden in the direction in which it is pulled, so we could make
super-ropes or bullet-proof vests out of cotton.  (Scratch that--- the
cotton would still deform when pushed by a bullet.  It would follow
the bullet with a finger-like extension through my chest.  Yuck!)
Another nice property is that we could release all of these quirks by
melting the material: as the solid structure loosens, the quirk
endpoints are released, allowing the rubber bands between them to pull
together.  When the quirk at one end meets the antiquirk at the other
end, the two disappear in a puff of radiation.  The material is now
unquirked.

<p>What could we do with a universal hardener?  Perhaps we could get
energy from <i>uncontrolled</i> nuclear fusion--- hydrogen bombs.
A volume of water 200 feet on each side would absorb all of the heat,
but we would need an indestructible water balloon to contain the
pressure wave.  Suppose the indestructible water balloon has a hole in
it pointing at a hydroelectric plant--- that torrent of water would
turn the turbines for a long time.  Or suppose we lasso asteroids with
a super-rope?  Perhaps we could tie together two asteroids with
specially chosen orbits so that they would be diverted toward Mars for
some deep-crust drilling.

<p>These are not predictions--- we have no evidence that there's any such
thing as a quirk.  It is one hypothetical scenario that I picked
because I like thinking about its consequences.  Scientists avoid
speculating too far beyond established facts because the chain of
``what if?'' becomes too fragile: a single false assumption can bring
down the whole house of cards.  This is why it is so difficult to say
what good will come of the discoveries made at frontiers like the LHC:
those discoveries are so many steps away from their applications that
any guesses are likely to be wrong.  But science fiction can fill this
gap.  Even if the premise is as ridiculous as an exoplanet that just
happens to collide with the Earth, it's still fun to think about.
