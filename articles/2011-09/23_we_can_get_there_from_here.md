<p>``Have you heard about this?  Opera says neutrinos travel faster
  than light!''

<p>I was in a conversation at Fermilab yesterday when I first heard
  about it.  ``Is that like one of those things where astrophysicists
  say that quasar jets travel faster than light, but only because
  they're leaving out some projection effect?'' I said.

<p>``No, this is for real.  Except--- I think so.  I can't really tell;
  the article doesn't say very much.''

<p>I shrugged.  I have no nose for news.  It was only when my wife
  asked me about it that I knew it was a big story.  She usually hears
  too much physics from me, so she doesn't actively seek it out.  By
  that point, it was in all the newspapers, the experimenters
  made <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897">their paper</a> public,
  and CERN's director general sent out a general e-mail.

<p>If it's true that neutrinos travel faster than light, it would be a
  huge upset.  Some may take it to mean that relativity is overturned,
  Einstein rolls in his grave, and there's no longer any limitation on
  the speed of future spaceships: we can get to distant stars in
  weeks, rather than decades.  However, the implications run a lot
  deeper than that.

<p>Relativity is a fact of life, as much as falling or heat and cold.
  We may not experience relativity in everyday things, but particle
  physicists encounter it daily.  It's not a small effect, something
  that might be a mirage.  In fact, in the conversation at Fermilab I
  was learning about special techniques to measure particles that
  travel significantly slower than the speed of
  light: <i>those</i> are the oddballs.  If this new observation about
  neutrinos is true, then it would have to fit into the constant
  stream of other observations.  The new data would have to augment relativity---
  they can't overturn it.

<p>Relativity is about rotation.  Unlike rotating a picture frame,
  which mixes one space dimension (the horizontal) with another (the
  vertical), relativity is about rotations that mix a space dimension
  with time.  Time is a dimension very much like length, width, and
  height, but with a minus sign in the mathematical expressions that
  makes a big difference.  Distances and time intervals can be
  measured in the same units: an inch of time is 85 picoseconds, and a
  minute of length is about 11 million miles.  A handy unit to
  remember is that a foot is one nanosecond.

<p>We can draw time and space in a single plot--- I drew an example
  below.  Looking at plots like this is a bit like viewing time on its
  side.  Everything that has any duration, like a human life, becomes
  a tall, thin strand: we're about six feet from head to foot, but
  three quintillion nanoseconds (95 years) from birth to death.  If I
  drew everything on the plot, all of the streaks of stars and
  spaghetti of intersecting human lives, we wouldn't be able to see
  anything, so I just drew one little spaceship.  It enters the frame
  at a constant speed from the bottom, then slows to a stop at the
  point.  The speed of the spaceship is distance-per-time: the
  steepness of the slope of its path.  Speed is an angle.

<div><img src="spacetime.jpg" alt="Plot of space and time, with the path of a spaceship"></div>
</div></div>

<p>Relativity is about rotations in space and time, which is to say,
  changing speed.  Whenever you change your speed, you rotate yourself
  in space and time.  This ``mixes'' space with
  time: you convert a little bit of what had been time into space, and
  what had been space into time.  To explain what I mean by this
  mixing, below is an example of a space-space rotation.  If we tilt a
  hanging picture, the picture's horizontal line becomes partly
  horizontal and partly vertical.  There's nothing magic about that:
  it's just a matter of how one defines horizontal and vertical.

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="rotation.jpg" alt="Rotated picture frame"></div>
</div></div>

<p>Space-time doesn't work exactly like that, because if we rotated
  180 degrees, we could reverse time!  The minus sign in the
  mathematical expression for space-time rotations changes the picture
  to the one below.  This is what the space-time plot
  would look like to someone at a different space-time angle, that is
  to say, a different speed.

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="spacetime2.jpg" alt="Rotated space-time"></div>
</div></div>

<p>The time and distance axes slant toward each other, and all paths
  squish and stretch in between.  At an extreme, if we rotate toward
  the speed of light, the time axis and distance axis get closer and
  closer to overlapping.  Light itself inhabits a strange world in
  which there is no difference between space and time.

<p>This mixing of space and time is only noticeable at high speeds,
  close to the speed of light.  However, there's no boundary line:
  it's always happening to some small degree.  For instance, if you
  walk toward the Andromeda Galaxy on a Wednesday, then it becomes
  next Saturday in Andromeda.  If you then turn and walk away from it,
  it becomes last Sunday in Andromeda.  Your space-time angle is very
  small at normal walking speeds, but the axis from here to Andromeda
  is long enough to easily shift it by a week.

<p>The experiment that seems to show particles moving faster than
  light is a collaboration between the European Laboratory CERN and
  the Italian Laboratory of Gran Sasso in the Alps.  CERN sends a beam
  of neutrinos from its accelerator complex in Geneva, Switzerland to
  Gran Sasso's underground (technically, under-mountain) laboratory,
  450 miles away.  Neutrinos pass through miles of rock without even
  noticing--- they interact so weakly that they are effectively
  ghosts.  In Gran Sasso, there is a large neutrino detector called
  Opera; the reason it is large is to improve the chances of detecting some of the
  few neutrino interactions.  Although the main purpose of the
  experiment is to study the way that neutrinos of one type change
  into another, they also measured the time of the neutrinos' flight
  and the distance between the labs very precisely in order to
  determine their speed.  There are some alternate theories of
  neutrino transformation and some theories of quantum gravity that
  predict that the neutrinos would slow down in various ways.  But
  instead, they observed the neutrinos traveling <i>faster</i> than
  expected, and faster than light.

<p>There's nothing in the theory of relativity that forbids
  faster-than-light particles.  Their mass would be an imaginary
  number (i.e. mass-squared is a negative number), but that's just
  strange, not forbidden.  For neutrinos in particular, however, we know from
  previous experiments that they have non-imaginary mass differences.
  That would have to be reconciled somehow.  If imaginary-mass
  particles exist, then they would never be able to go slower than the
  speed of light--- such things were called tachyons when theorists
  played with the idea in string theory.  The problem with
  faster-than-light particles is a philosophical one: they can tell us
  the future.

<p>Taking the Gran Sasso measurement as a case-in-point, Gran Sasso is
  2.4 million nanoseconds distant from CERN (450 miles), and they
  measured the neutrinos arriving 2.4 million minus 60 nanoseconds
  after they left CERN.  These measurements were all made by
  stationary clocks (with the exception of a satellite, but it was
  calibrated for Earth-time).  From our perspective, the neutrinos appear to be slightly
  faster than light, but from a different perspective, an observer
  traveling at relativistic speeds, they would be much faster
  than light, or even happen in the wrong order: Gran Sasso receives
  the neutrinos before CERN sends them.  This is just what happens
  when you apply normal relativistic rotations to particles traveling
  faster than light.  For an observer traveling at 99.999999992% of
  the speed of light, the timing of ``CERN-emits'' and ``Gran
  Sasso-receives'' can be completely reversed, so that ``CERN-emits''
  happens 2.4 million minus 60 nanoseconds after ``Gran
  Sasso-receives.''  This is not an incredibly high speed: a proton
  with 80 TeV of energy (a little more than ten times the LHC's design
  energy) would be going that fast.  Faster-than-light travel is not a
  different thing from time-travel--- if you have one, you the other.

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="pointsofview.jpg" alt="The same event in four different points of veiw"></div>
</div></div>

<p>Now imagine that the high-speed observer can emit neutrinos.  As
  he passes by Gran Sasso, he sends neutrinos to CERN if Gran Sasso
  received neutrinos from CERN.  If CERN gets neutrinos, they choose
  not to send neutrinos to Gran Sasso.  Now neutrinos only get sent
  around if they don't get sent around: a paradox!

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="paradox.jpg" alt="Box-diagram of the paradox"></div>
</div></div>

<p>If this faster-than-light thing stands up to scrutiny, you know this
  is the first thing we'll try to do.  You just know it is.

<p>So what about that measurement?  Can we believe it?  There's a
  strong temptation to pull something out of the procedure and say,
  ``This part must be wrong; the whole thing is crap,'' but after
  reading their paper and listening to the spokesperson's presentation
  and response to questions, I don't see any obvious faults.  They
  took it very seriously and measured nearly all steps in the chain
  multiple times in multiple ways.  There's another strong temptation
  to say, ``Gee wiz, time travel!'' but that would be jumping way
  ahead of the facts.  It takes time to confirm an observation, to
  find the same thing emerge in so many different ways that it must be
  true.  I want to believe it or disbelieve it: I hate suspense!  The
  hardest part of science is the ache of uncertainty.

<p>The first caveat in the experiment is that the initial time of each
  neutrino is not known.  When I heard about this experiment, I
  imagined someone starting a clock at the instant that the neutrino
  was produced at CERN and someone stopping a clock when it was
  received in Gran Sasso.  Not quite.  In order to make large batches
  of neutrinos (in the hopes that a few will be seen), they are
  produced in long bursts from the accelerator, about 10 thousand
  nanoseconds from start to finish.  The neutrino that is detected in
  Gran Sasso might be from the start of the burst, the end of the
  burst, or anywhere in between.  How, then, could they have possibly
  measured a 60 nanosecond difference in arrival time?

<p>They accumulated a large number of neutrinos (16 thousand) and
  statistically fitted the distribution.  CERN measured the shape of
  the burst, the Opera detector cataloged the arrival times of all the
  neutrinos, and the analysis team varied the time-offset between the
  shape and the observed distribution until they fit.  Here's what
  that looks like (copied
  from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897">their paper</a>):

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="timebox.jpg" alt="Fitted distribution of neutrino events"></div>
</div></div>

<p>The start-time of any one neutrino is unknown, but you can learn
  what you need to from a distribution of all of them.  This is
  standard practice in particle physics, especially where the
  uncertainties of quantum mechanics play a role.  It looks like a
  good fit, but the relevant scale is 60 nanoseconds, while the
  horizontal axis covers 10 thousand nanoseconds.  They provide a
  close-up of the leading and trailing edges, which are the most
  important parts of the fit:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="edges.jpg" alt="Close-up of the leading and trailing edges"></div>
</div></div>

<p>The other caveat about the measurement is that it could not be
  performed by a single clock.  There must be at least two clocks: one
  at CERN and the other at Gran Sasso, and they need to be
  synchronized.  But the experiment is in a hard-to-reach location, so
  a long series of clocks is needed, including a satellite link.  Even
  something as mundane as cabling could ruin the measurement:
  electronics signals pass through cables close to the speed of light,
  which is 60 nanoseconds = 60 extra feet of cables.  The electronics
  themselves needed to be carefully calibrated, since signals pass
  more slowly through computers than wires.  The distance also had to
  be surveyed through all the tunnels that lead down to the
  underground experiment.  The surveying operation was complicated by
  the fact that they could only close one lane of traffic.

<p>The only way to know if there isn't an error somewhere in the chain
  is to cross-check each step carefully.  I got the impression from
  the spokesperson that a lot of different techniques were used to do
  all of this double-checking, and there were naturally a lot of
  questions about each part.  The number of reviewers has just
  increased dramatically, but we need to wait to see if someone finds
  something.

<p>Even though I can't say that I know the result is wrong, I have a
  strong suspicion that neutrinos do not travel faster than light.  My
  personal bias is based on the philosophical paradox that would be
  raised if anything could travel faster than light.

<p>Suppose that closer investigation reveals some error, or that
  follow-up experiments do not find any faster-than-light neutrinos.
  This sort of thing has happened before.  Would that be a
  disappointment?  I bet most of the excitement over this result is
  the expectation that it would make a Star Trek future possible: it's
  a bummer that stars are so far away, especially the ones with the
  most interesting aliens.  I mean it.  
  Many science fiction universes have some kind of
  faster-than-light travel for good reason.

<a name="distanceTable">
<p>But this isn't necessary.  Relativity, the cursed limitation on our
  space-faring dreams, provides its own escape.  While a spacecraft
  cannot reach a star 20 light-years away in less than 20 years, as
  measured on Earth, the crew of the spacecraft would enjoy a shorter
  trip.  This is especially true if the spacecraft were accelerating
  all the way there.

<p>Suppose that a spacecraft accelerates toward its destination at a
  rate equal to Earth's gravity: 9.8 meters per seconds-squared is
  equal to 1.0 light years per years-squared.  The craft gradually
  becomes relativistic during the first half of the trip, turns around
  half way and slows down during the second half of the trip.  The
  relationship between traveler time and Earth time is exponential:
  light years take years, but millions of light years take decades.
  These are all the places we could go:

<p>We can get there from here--- we can go anywhere in the universe in
  a lifetime.  But we can never come back.
