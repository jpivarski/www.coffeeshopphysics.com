<p>I never really understood General Relativity until I learned to
  sew, just as I never really understood thermodynamics until I
  learned to cook.  As with cooking, I was driven to sewing by
  necessity: my jeans didn't fit.  The first modifications were small
  ones: darts here and there to pull in material, later I added elastic
  waistbands, then suspenders.

<p>Eventually I got so fed up with the bad fit that I decided to make
  my own jeans from scratch.  I bought a few yards of fabric, wrapped
  it around myself, and started cutting.  Mistakes weren't a problem:
  I knew how to patch and I figured I would just keep cutting and
  patching until the thing fit around my body.  It took about a week
  for the carpet to slowly evolve into pantaloons.  I finished them
  just in time to wear them when my wife came home from a conference,
  whereupon she exclaimed, ``They're purple!''  Pants 1.0 have been
  described as part-Joker, part-Catwoman, and they lasted about a year.

<p>Spending all that time with fabric forced me to think a lot about
  topology and curvature.  I had to somehow reproduce my own curvature
  in cloth: too much curvature and it would bulge, too little and
  it would be tight.  The most difficult part is the crotch, which
  bends upward in the front and back, but downward toward the legs.
  ``Oh,'' I realized, ``That's what it means to be negatively
  curved!''  Zero and positive curvature are easy to understand from
  textbooks, but negative curvature is always drawn as a twisted bit
  of graph paper, mysteriously called a saddle-point.  ``Of course
  it's a saddle,'' I said to myself.  ``What else are saddles meant to
  fit?''

<p>In popular explanations of General Relativity, it is common to say
  that space-time is like a rubber sheet, curving under the weight of
  planets and stars.  The planets are marbles that someone has set on the rubber
  sheet, to show that the sheet does, in fact, bend.  This explanation
  has always bothered me because the marbles are outside of the
  sheet.  If the sheet is supposed to represent space, then everything
  ought to be within the sheet itself.  Moreover, the demonstration only
  works because the real Earth is under the rubber sheet, drawing
  marbles toward itself.

<p>And while sheets can be curved, what could it possibly mean for
  space to be curved?  How could I ever visualize that?

<p>In school, I learned about the mathematics of curvature and its
  application to space-time, the theory of gravitation known as
  General Relativity.  The formal definition of curvature is based on
  an intuitive concept, but is complicated by the subtlety of
  continuity.  Fabrics approximate continuity with small
  but not infinitesimal stitches, so in the end it was the ancient art
  of shaping cloth with thread that helped me to visualize curved space-time.
  Video games helped, too.

<p>How is cloth like space?  For this metaphor to work, we have to
  imagine being a drawing on the cloth--- in other words,
  two-dimensional.  I've only ever been two-dimensional in video
  games, such as the kind where I'm a dungeon with many rooms.
  Each room has a north, south, east, and west, but up and down are
  meaningless.  There are doors at the edges of the room; these lead
  to other rooms, some with hidden treasure or monsters.

<p>It looked a bit like this:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="dungeon_room.jpg" alt="Video game room, rendered in cloth"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>Video game character in a dungeon room with four exits: north,
  south, east, and west.
</div></div>

<p>Video games aren't usually projected in cloth, but there's no
  conceptual reason not to--- only technological.  (Cloth computer
  screens would be pretty cool!)  The way the character moves wouldn't
  be altered by folding the cloth: adjacent stitches (pixels) are
  still adjacent when the cloth is folded.  Our hero would crawl
  around the crease without ever realizing that his world isn't spread
  flat.

<p>His world can be changed, however, by how we sew it.  Suppose that
  we sew the east door of the room to the west door: when our hero
  walks out through one door, he finds himself walking in through the
  other.  His whole dungeon appears to be a long east-west
  corridor of identical rooms.

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="circular_dungeon.jpg" alt="East door sewn to west door"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>A dungeon room with the east door sewn to the west door, so that
  the character can go around and around.
</div></div>

<p>These kinds of connections can be arbitrarily made in video games:
  the programmer just needs to type, ``if (exit through west) then
  {enter through east;}.''  It's like a hyperlink on a web page.  We
  could imagine something similar in our three-dimensional world
  without having to visualize it as a four-dimensional suture.  While there
  isn't any known way to make wormholes or looped spaces in reality,
  the idea is all over science fiction, from Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A
  Wrinkle in Time</i> to Neil Gaiman's <i>Coraline.</i>

<p>In this article, I'd like to talk about a different kind of
  connection.  A looped space is made from one weird connection---
  curvature is made from weird connections all over the place.

<p>Suppose that we build a dungeon from a network of linked rooms with
  two north doors for every one south door.  Every step in latitude
  has twice as many rooms as the previous.  I could draw a map of it
  like this:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="map.jpg" alt="Map of a hyperbolic dungeon"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>Map of a dungeon with two north doors for every south door; blue
  lines are hyperlinks connecting the rooms.
</div></div>

<p>Since the two north doors lead in different directions, I'm calling
  them ``ronth'' and ``ornth.''  The rooms get very crowded at the
  top, so I decided to shrink them in my map.  In the world of the video game, though,
  they're all the same size.

<p>Here's a better way to represent them:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="curly_dungeons.jpg" alt="Cloth model of a hyperbolic dungeon"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>The dungeon modeled in cloth.
</div></div>

<p>When these rooms are sewn together, they form a lumpy surface like
  a lettuce leaf.  Our hero doesn't know that: to him, it's just a
  two-dimensional world.  But there are many more places to explore
  than there are in the normal rectangular dungeon.

<p>This is what it means for a space to be curved.  We say that the
  cloth is curved because it cannot be laid flat due to the way that it is
  stitched--- this is something more than merely folding a normal sheet of
  cloth.  A curved cloth cannot be made uncurved without cutting or
  stretching.  The two-dimensional space corresponding to that cloth
  is also curved.  To make the correspondence explicit, imagine a
  computer screen pixel for every stitch in the fabric.  The essence
  of curvature is the way that pixels--- points in space--- are
  connected to each other.

<p>Despite his two-dimensionalness, the video game character knows
  that his world is curved.  One experiment he can do is to measure
  the length of paths between two points:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="curly_dungeons2.jpg" alt="Same model with two labeled paths"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>Two paths from room A to room B.  The lower one is a shorter path.
</div></div>

<p>In an uncurved space, the shortest path between two rooms at the
  same latitude is a straight east-west line.  To get from room A to
  room B, we might imagine that the shortest way would be to go
  east-east-east-east-east-east-east: 7 rooms.  But in this space,
  south-south-east-ornth-ornth is shorter: 5 rooms.  Even to our video
  game hero, this does not seem to be a straight path--- first he's
  going south, then he's going ornth!  But it is undeniably shorter:
  breadcrumbs prove it.

<p>Experiments like this measure the degree of curvature.  If the
  shortest path appears to be very curved, then the space-curvature
  must be very large.  In an uncurved space (curvature equals zero),
  the shortest paths are perfectly straight lines.  In a positively
  curved space, such as the surface of a globe, the shortest paths are
  great arcs: airplanes fly over Iceland on their way from Chicago to
  Switzerland.  The video game space we've been considering here is
  negatively curved, and if we had three north doors for every south
  door, then it would be even more negatively curved.

<p>Perhaps the most important example of a negatively curved space,
  apart from the crotch of my pants, is the world we live in.  Close
  to the surface of the Earth, space-time is negatively curved.  This
  curvature is very slight, but it is not zero.

<p>To see the effect of this curvature in our everyday lives, we need
  to consider time as a dimension, like length, breadth, and height.
  Time intervals are distances, much like distances in space.  Our
  perception of time is extremely foreshortened compared to our
  perception of space: one nanosecond of time is about as long as one
  foot.  When we move, we trace out paths in space-time.  Seen from
  the side, we are long, tapered creatures, only six feet high but
  three quintillion nanoseconds (95 years) long.  And we lace around
  each other, threading through our lives like a mass of spaghetti.

<p>Here is what a negatively curved space-time looks like:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="leap2" alt="Curved cloth with one direction labeled 'time'"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>Curved cloth representing height and time.  (Note: this is only
  schematic, to convey the idea.  The true shape is a little different.)
</div></div>

<p>In this piece of cloth, the horizontal direction represents time
  and the vertical direction represents height.  I drew the video game
  character incorrectly--- in space-time, he would look like a snake,
  rather than having a back and a front that faces forward in time.  I
  plead artistic license.  In the time interval represented here, he
  leaps directly upward and falls back down.  Apart from the initial
  leap, the course of his path through space-time is dictated solely
  by gravity.

<p>That path is a parabolic arc.  He rises, slows to a stop, and then
  falls back down at an ever-increasing rate.  Though it is curved,
  this path is the shortest way from the initial position to the final
  one, much like the walk through the curved dungeon.  If he had
  instead stayed on the ground, he would follow the rounded bottom
  edge through time, which is longer.  The shortest paths through
  space-time are always falls.

<p>According to General Relativity, that's how gravity works.
  Skydivers feel weightless as they fall because they are: they are
  following the same kind of path through space-time as they would in
  deep space, far from the Earth.  When we stand on the ground, we
  feel pushed into our feet.  This is like the sideways push we feel
  in a car that is turning around a tight corner, for exactly the same
  reason: both are unnaturally long paths through space-time.
  Something must deflect our path from the natural one.  When we stand
  on the ground, it is the solidity of the earth that prevents our
  feet from following the shortest path through space-time: straight
  down.  When we turn a corner in a car, it is the seat-belt that
  prevents us from following the shortest path: straight ahead.

<p>The curvature that causes a flying arc through the air to be a
  shorter space-time path than just staying on the ground is an
  extremely small one: our space-time is very nearly flat.  On the
  second floor of a building, time intervals are only one part in a
  quadrillion longer than they are on the first floor.  For a GPS
  satellite in orbit, an hour and one microsecond passes for every
  hour on the ground, and they need to be routinely synchronized to
  correct for this.

<p>This tiny curvature is only noticeable to us because we have a
  foreshortened perception of time.  It takes billions of
  nanoseconds--- that is, a few seconds--- to see the path of a tossed
  object deflect a few feet.

<p>Though the Earth's gravitational curvature is tiny, we are
  sensitive to the passage of time at exactly the right rate to be
  aware of it.  It makes me wonder if this is a biological adaptation
  to living on Earth, much like the fact that we can only see the
  colors of light that can penetrate Earth's atmosphere.  Would
  creatures that evolve in low-gravity environments--- asteroids---
  sense time much more slowly than us?  Would creatures in
  high-gravity--- the cooled husk of an ancient white dwarf star---
  seem to live at a maniacal pace?
