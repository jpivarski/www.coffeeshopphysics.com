<p>My fourth grade teacher was a child of Irish immigrants, and sometimes
he told stories in class.  My favorite went like this:
leprechauns are bound by a law that obliges them to do whatever you
say if you catch them.  One day, a man caught a leprechaun and ordered
him to reveal the location of his pot of gold.  The leprechaun was
furious, but he had no choice.  He led the man through the forest to
an old tree and said, ``There.  Me treasure is under the roots
of that tree,'' and that was the truth.

<p>The man needed an axe and a shovel to get at the gold, so he tied a
ribbon around the tree to mark it while he went back to town for some
tools.  He commanded the leprechaun not to take down the ribbon or
move his gold or anything like that.  The leprechaun, still under
obligation, grumbled but agreed.  When the man returned with his
tools, the tree was still marked by its ribbon, but so was every tree
in the whole forest.  He never found that treasure.

<p>The beauty of the leprechaun's trick is that a completely
  ribboned forest has exactly as much information as an unribboned
  forest.  A ribbon on every tree except one would convey as much as a
  ribbon on one tree.  This ``amount of information'' is called
  entropy, and it is as much a physical quantity as length, voltage,
  and temperature.  In fact, I think that entropy is a more
  fundamental concept than temperature--- knowing about entropy makes
  it easier to understand what temperature is.

<p>The most useful physics to know for cooking is the fact that heat
  is different from temperature.  Heat is a thing, it's a form of
  energy, almost a substance.  It flows from the burner to the pot of
  boiling water and spreads throughout the room.  It has to go
  somewhere; it can't just disappear.  Heat can change into other
  forms of energy, or even matter--- a nuclear power plant turns
  matter into heat.

<p>Temperature, on the other hand, is more abstract.  It is a quantity
  that is equalized when things touch: ice and tea exchange heat
  until they have the same temperature.  So does fudge and a candy
  thermometer, but the candy thermometer assigns arbitrary numbers to
  this mysterious quantity.  Liquids boil and foods burn at specific
  temperatures, not amounts of heat, so it's an important number.  The
  dials on most stoves set the rate of heat flow, rather than
  temperature, so higher settings should be used for something watery
  (water absorbs a lot of heat per degree of temperature) than for something
  oily (oil absorbs less heat for the same temperature).

<p>Though we use temperature every day, it has no meaning other than
  marks on a thermometer unless we first know about entropy.  Entropy
  is sometimes described as disorder or randomness, but that's not
  always a useful way to think about it.  When I add memory chips to
  my computer, it is to increase the computer's entropy, but I don't
  want the computer to become random or disorderly!

  The leprechaun's trick provides a great example of entropy.  The
  forest's entropy can be defined as the number of ways to tie ribbons
  on trees, within a restriction.  For instance, if the
  restriction is that the leprechaun can only use one ribbon, then
  there are as many ways to do it as there are trees in the forest.  A
  meaning could be associated with the tree that gets the ribbon, such
  as ``thar be gold here,'' but it is not necessary.

<p>If the leprechaun is allowed to use two ribbons, then there are
  many more ways to do it: a thousand-tree forest has almost a million
  (1000 &#215; 999 = 999,000) ways to hang two ribbons.  With enough
  ribbons, the leprechaun can encode complex messages.  Ribboned and
  unribboned trees could represent ones and zeros in a binary
  sequence, as in a computer.  But if he is forced to use nearly as
  many ribbons as there are trees, his options become limited again.
  With 999 ribbons in a thousand-tree forest, there are only a
  thousand ways to pick the tree that doesn't get a ribbon.  And
  there's only one way to tie a ribbon on every tree, so if he must
  use one thousand ribbons, one per tree, the leprechaun cannot convey
  any information at all.  ``To the constant consternation of
  extortionists and thieves,'' he says, tamping his pipe.

<p>Calling entropy an ``amount of information'' may sound
  more applicable to computers than to a pot of water heating on the
  stove, but it's useful for both.  A pot of water is made of atoms,
  and atoms have locations and velocities--- that is, information.
  The number of ways to arrange the positions and velocities of all
  the atoms is beyond astronomical.  <img style="float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="rackham3.jpg" alt="Random fairies">  Instead of dealing with big
  numbers, we just count digits: one million has six digits, ten
  million has seven digits, etc.  Entropy is proportional to the
  number of digits in the number of combinations.

<p>Not every combination of atom velocities is relevant for the pot of water,
  however.  Fast-moving atoms have more energy than slow-moving ones,
  so some combinations would add up to more energy than the pot really
  has, some less.  Only the combinations with the right total energy
  should be counted.  This restriction is like specifying the number
  of ribbons that the leprechaun must use in his forest.  Just like
  the ribbons, the amount of energy dictates the number of possible
  combinations.  As more energy becomes available, the number of
  combinations typically grows, faster for some materials than for
  others.  This is the essence of temperature.

<p>Temperature is the amount of heat energy we'd have to add to a
  material to change its entropy by a given amount.  If you are
  familiar with calculus, it is the derivative of heat with respect to
  entropy.  If not, consider the graph below.  Entropy is the
  horizontal axis, energy is the vertical, and two different materials
  have relationships between energy and entropy given by the two
  curves.  Temperature is the steepness of the curves.

<p>For most substances, having a lot of heat means having a high
temperature, but this is not always the case.

<p>The most direct physical analogue of the leprechaun's forest is a
  laser beam.  In a laser, a substance is restricted to only two
  energy levels (or only a few).  The laser light comes from atoms dropping
  from the high-energy state to the low-energy state.  Think of the
  atoms in the high-energy state as trees with ribbons on them and
  those in the low-energy state as trees without ribbons.

<p>When a laser is off, all or most of the atoms are in the low
  state.  To turn on the laser, we start adding energy to the system.
  It is now like a forest with a small number of ribbons.  Each new ribbon
  increases the number of possible combinations, so the relationship
  between energy and entropy looks like this:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="valkarye.jpg" alt="Energy increasing with entropy"></div>
</div></div>

<p>As we continue to pour energy into the system, the
  number of possible atomic combinations grows--- up to a point.  When
  the laser reaches half-power, there are as many high-energy atoms as
  low-energy atoms, all jumping up and down, rapidly exchanging
  energy.  As with the ribbons in the forest, this is the point of
  maximum entropy.  Adding more energy reduces the number of
  combinations.  At full power, nearly all of the atoms are in the
  high-energy state, so the number of possible combinations is small
  again, like a forest full of ribbons.  The graph looks like this:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="valkarye2.jpg" alt="Energy increasing with entropy: the curve doubles back on itself"></div>
</div></div>

<div class="figure right"><div class="figurerow">
<div><img src="lasercannon.jpg" alt="Activating the laser cannon"></div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
<p>``Blight, Bright, and Spigot activated the laser cannon, whereupon
  it glowed and hummed faintly.''</p>
</div></div>

<p>Since the curve has doubled back on itself, the temperature is
  negative--- less than absolute zero!  The laser in your CD player
  routinely breaks the supposed law that nothing can be colder than
  absolute zero temperature.  (The actual law is that nothing can
  reach exactly zero.  The laser strives toward zero from below.)
  The laser doesn't feel cold because it has a lot of heat, and when
  that heat is transferred to your body, it increases your entropy in
  the normal way: positive temperature.  This is because the atoms in
  your body, like most materials, are not limited to two energy
  states.

<p>The laser is an unusual example, but it shows us what a weird
  concept temperature can be, and how it has as much to do with
  information as it does with heat.

<p>Since temperature is such an abstract concept, I'd like to try to
  convince weathermen to report the daily warmth in a more natural
  way--- heat transfer rate through skin.  As a unit of energy per
  time, this quantity would be measured in watts, and a chart would
  look a bit like this:

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="rackham5.jpg" alt="Random fairies">

<div class="figure inline">
<div class="figurerow">
<div><table>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;">&#8722;500 watts</td><td>naked in outer space (all heat leaves
    the body)</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;">&#8722;200 watts</td><td>too damn cold!</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;">&#8722;100 watts</td><td>cozy (normal human heat output)</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;">0 watts</td><td>like bathing in warm blood
    (literally)</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center; width: 150px;">anything more</td><td>too damn hot!</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div></div>

<p>It would be a very human-centric scale, since factors like body
  temperature and the way that humidity interacts with skin would have
  to be included in the calculation (or experiment, using a
  NIST-standard human).  Leprechauns would have to get their own scale.
