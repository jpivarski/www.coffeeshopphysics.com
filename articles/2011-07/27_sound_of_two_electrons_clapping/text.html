<p>Paszenko the Cat is a music critic.  I don't say that just because
  he looks for a better place to nap whenever I play my cello--- I
  wouldn't blame any creature for that.  It's because he seeks out
  good music.  He sits attentively, ears forward, whenever the music
  is harmonious and full of pentatonic intervals.  But he has no
  patience for anything as modern as a diminished fifth.

<p>My cat made his tastes obvious one day when a tutor came to give me
  cello lessons.  The cellos came out of their boxes and Paszenko
  casually left the room.  But when my teacher began to play, he came
  back.  He got closer, sniffed the strange cello, and hopped into the
  teacher's lap while he was still playing.  And purred.

<p>What colors a sound most is the path that it takes to get into our
  ears.  From cello string to bridge to chamber to cat's body
  sounds different than it would if it had bounced around the room before
  reaching Paszenko's eardrums.  As the waves flow from one object to
  another, they excite resonances whose frequencies depend on the
  shapes of those objects--- the fancy curves in a cello's body are not
  merely decorative.  Remote as it may seem, the creation and
  destruction of subatomic particles works the same way.  This is more
  than an analogy: it is one of the ways nature repeats herself at
  vastly different scales.

<p>Sound is a vibration in a material such as string, wood, or air.
  High-pitched sounds are rapid oscillations, while low-pitched sounds
  are slow.  Most sounds involve two or more frequencies at the same
  time: imagine a low note and a high note played simultaneously---
  it sounds different from a single note in the middle with the average
  frequency.  A wave with two frequencies looks like a rapid wiggle on
  top of a leisurely undulation, and our ears can identify both parts.  In
  fact, our ears have receptors to distinguish 15--20 thousand
  different frequencies at the same time: we usually hear them as
  complex textures.

<p>The richness of a cello's voice is due to the many overlapping
  frequencies it produces at once, even when the cellist only intends
  to play one note.  The peculiarities of the cello's shape enhances
  some frequencies and suppresses others as the waves propagate from the
  string through the bridge into its big wooden bubble.  The
  plot below shows the spectrum of a cello playing a G<sup>#</sup>
  note: the tall peaks are frequencies that resonate loudly (large
  amplitude), and the gaps between them are relatively silent.

<p>Keep in mind that all of these frequencies are active when the cello is
  playing only one note.  This pattern is not what makes a
  G<sup>#</sup> sound different from a G, but what makes a cello sound
  different from an oboe.  The two sound clips below demonstrate what
  this spectrum does: one is played by a cello (not me) and
  the other is synthesized with pure tones.  Both have melody and
  dynamics, but the pure-tones version plays exactly one frequency at
  a time.  It is what a cello would sound like without its
  characteristic spectrum.

<p>Subatomic particles such as electrons and quarks are vibrations in
  a mathematical abstraction called a field.  A field is a set of
  numbers at every point in space, and a vibration in the field is
  when the numbers increase and decrease rapidly, like the height of water in a
  rippling pond, but without the pond.  Energetic particles are rapid
  oscillations of the field, while lethargic particles are slow
  oscillations, much like high-pitched and low-pitched sounds.

<p>There is a field for every type of particle: an electron field for
  electrons and positrons (positrons are the antimatter version of
  electrons), a quark field for each of the different kinds of quarks, a
  photon field for light, and many others.  Not only can waves flow
  from one place to another--- that's how particles move--- but waves
  can flow from one field into another--- that's how old particles
  disintegrate and new particles are born.

<p>Here's how subatomic particles resemble sound: a sound wave that
  propagates into the resonant body of the cello and, from there, into
  the air and our ears is much like an electron wave that flows into
  the photon field (becomes light) and then flows into a quark field
  (becomes quarks).  The phenomena are so similar that physicists use
  the same terminology and mathematical tools for both--- they only
  differ in the details.

<p>To be specific, let's consider an activity that has become common
  among physicists: accelerating particles to high speeds and smashing
  them together.  If they are equal and opposite particles, like an
  electron and an positron, then their energy can flow into any other
  equal and opposite: a quark and an antiquark, a muon and an
  antimuon, or even a neutrino and an antineutrino.  The degree to
  which energy flows into each of these fields depends on how well it
  is ``coupled'' to the electron field.  This coupling is another
  abstraction--- a number, nothing to visualize.  However, it's a lot
  like coupling in acoustics.  On a cello, the degree to which energy
  flows from a vibrating string into the wooden body depends on how
  tightly they are coupled by the bridge.  In our universe, the
  electron field is much more tightly coupled to the quark field than
  it is to the neutrino field, so electron-positron collisions are
  more likely to result in quarks than neutrinos.  The entirety of
  particle physics is to learn what fields exist and understand why
  they have the couplings that they do.

<p>To be even more specific, suppose we collide an electron and a
  positron with 15 GeV of energy.  That's a lot of energy, but not an
  enormous amount.  How much flows into the quark fields?  The plot
  below shows the result: it is the quark spectrum that is excited by
  a 15 GeV electron-positron (e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>−</sup>) collision,
  in exact analogy with the cello spectrum above.  The tall peaks
  indicate frequencies that resonate loudly, and the gaps between them
  are relatively silent.

<p>This could be thought of as the sound of an electron and a positron
  colliding.  The particles are too small to cause air molecules to
  vibrate--- what we normally call sound.  But if we're interested in
  the characteristic frequencies that the collisions produce, we could
  think of the vibrations of the quark fields as something like a
  sound.  This sound is universal: the same spectrum is produced by
  electrons and positrons colliding in a basement accelerator as in
  the atmosphere of a neutron star, thousands of light years away.
  Just as the mellow tone of a cello derives from its peculiar size
  and shape, the spectrum of the quark field, when plucked with 15
  GeV, has something to do with the field's geometry.

<p>Let's listen to that spectrum.  It is way too high-pitched for
  human hearing, so I transposed it down 74 octaves.  Here is what
  it sounds like for one electron to collide with one positron:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<?php place_sound("collide_1_electron.mp3", "collide_1_electron"); ?>
</div></div>

<p>The interference of waves with slightly different frequencies
  causes some sounds to be short-lived while others linger.  Listen a
  few times to hear how the initial ping differs from the sustained
  ringing.  Or instead listen to the clip below, which is the sound of
  10,000 e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>−</sup> pairs colliding over the course of a few
  seconds--- this extends the short-lived part in a realistic way
  (laboratory experiments rarely collide just one pair of particles).
  
<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<?php place_sound("collide_10000_electrons.mp3", "collide_10000_electrons"); ?>
</div></div>

<p>It sounds pure, like bells or windchimes, because the quark
  spectrum has far fewer resonances than a cello.  The rain-like
  tapping of low-pitched, short-lived sounds is due to the rho
  resonance.  Rho is made of quarks like the ones in ordinary protons,
  but it is so unsturdy that it falls apart in a millionth of a
  billionth of a billionth of a second.  The mid-range jingle is known
  as charm--- its simplicity and straight-forward interpretation
  convinced a generation of scientists that quarks are real, not just
  a convenient fiction in calculations.  The faint, high-pitched hum
  at the end is called beauty.  I think it sounds like a gong that has
  stopped ringing, but is still tremulous to the touch.
