<p class="reprinted">(This was the original ``about page,'' but I have converted it into a full-length article.)

<p>I used to hate coffee.  Though I knew that it's an acquired taste,
  I couldn't understand why anyone would want to acquire <i>that</i>
  taste: it was like drinking ink.

<p>My wife tried to introduce me to the joys of coffee the way she had
  been raised: creamer first.  When she was young, she sipped the
  little cups of creamer with one drop of coffee added to each, then
  gradually increased the ratio.  I tried some coffee ice cream, but
  it seemed like a waste of good vanilla.

<p>My conversion, however, was inevitable: I'm a particle physicist,
  and the two things that particle physicists do socially are drinking
  coffee and skiing.  Many important physics conversations happen over
  coffee, the way that tobacco presided over Native American
  covenants.  One day at CERN, a Swiss colleague offered me a cup
  while we worked out the details of some project, and I said, ``Sure,
  thank you,'' to be polite.

<p>He hesitated for a moment, then asked, ``Do you take it with or
  without pollutants?''

<!-- more -->

<p>``Uh--- I suppose without.''

<p>``Excellent.''  He brought me a cup of black coffee, almost espresso,
  with no cream or sugar.

<p>I found myself strangely enjoying it.  It didn't taste good--- it
  simply <i>was</i> good.  I had been missing the point all along.
  Coffee isn't a drink like soda or orange juice, it's a
  ritual: it comes in small cups that you warm your hands on and sip
  slowly--- meditation with a touch of caffeine.

<p>My wife and I are now learning how to make good coffee at home
  (mine black and hers with cream), since it's hard to pop over to
  Europe for a cup.  The two best methods that we've found don't
  require any expensive machines; just a French press for coffee and a
  moka pot for espresso (pictured above).  The process of making
  coffee or espresso focuses one's attention on so many physical
  details--- sinking the scooper into a can of hard beans, the smell
  of grinding coffee, dusting the grounds off of the blades, tamping
  them into the pot like a bed of loose soil, listening for the
  gurgling to keep the now-empty pot from burning--- this intent focus
  on the specifics of reality is, I believe, the soul of physics.

<p>Many of the major breakthroughs in physics started as a fascination
  with the way some little thing behaves.  That fascination led to
  tinkering, the tinkering led to controlled experiments, the
  experiments led to facts, and facts have the power to fundamentally
  change our outlook on the world.

<p>Consider the mushroom-like plumes that cream makes when poured into
  hot coffee.  Something special is happening: first, the cream floats
  up and pushes against the coffee, then changes somehow by the heat
  and reverses; the coffee pushes against the cream, leaving tendrils
  of black and white that twist and intertwine until the whole liquid
  becomes a smooth mocha brown.  Some interaction of viscosity,
  temperature gradients, and maybe even surface tension might explain
  it, but the first reaction is, ``Wow--- look at that!''  An artist
  would draw it.  A physicist tries to reproduce it in the lab.

<p>When Leonardo da Vinci observed the patterns made by flowing water,
  he was inspired to draw the sketch shown on the right.  In the
  accompanying text, he described the patterns as being ``like hair,''
  with the main current being the weight of the hair and the eddying
  motions like curls.  The artistic practice of ``seeing,'' that is,
  rendering something as you really see it, rather than as you expect
  it to be, is also the aim of science.

<!-- Observe the motion of the surface of the water, which resembles that -->
<!-- of hair, which has two motions, of which one is caused by the weight -->
<!-- of the hair, the other by the direction of the curls; thus the water -->
<!-- has eddying motions, one part of which is due to the principal -->
<!-- current, the other to the random and reverse motion. -->

<!-- So moving water strives to maintain the course pursuant to the power -->
<!-- which occasions it and, if it finds an obstacle in its path, completes -->
<!-- the span of the course it has commenced by a circular and revolving -->
<!-- movement. -->

<!-- The small eddies are almost numberless, and large things are rotated -->
<!-- only by large eddies and not by small ones, and small things are -->
<!-- turned by both small eddies and large -->

<p>Centuries later, da Vinci's curls became known as vortices, and the
  pattern of eddying flow is called turbulence in fluid dynamics.  The
  picture below and to the left is from an experiment with turbulence.
  A thin film of soap pours from the top of the picture to the bottom
  of the picture, and it flows past a moving paddle on the top.
  Although the knowledge gained from experiments like this can be used
  to design faster boats and airplanes, it was motivated by watching
  fish.  Fish make these patterns as they swim through water; the
  scientist wanted to find out how the precise motion of the fish
  (modeled by the paddle) affects the eddy currents it leaves in its
  wake.

<p>The picture on the right was taken by an astronaut, through a
  window on the space shuttle.  The same pattern of repeating curls
  can be seen in clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, miles from one end to
  the other.

<p>By far the most amazing vortices that I've ever seen are the vortices
  in superfluids.  Some liquids, when chilled to nearly absolute zero
  temperature (−460°F), dramatically change into a new state of matter
  with weird properties.  This state of matter is called
  ``superfluid'' by analogy with the similar phenomenon of
  superconductivity, and it is one of the few manifestations of
  quantum mechanics that is large enough to see with human eyes.
  Superfluids do things that are unsettlingly perfect--- perfectly
  smooth, zero viscosity, infinite thermal conductivity--- like a
  mathematical idealization in real life.

<p>One of the weird properties of a superfluid is that it cannot be
  rotated.  Think about that for a moment.  If somebody told me that
  an object cannot be rotated, I'd say, ``Watch this,'' as I grab the
  thing and spin it by hand.  When you try that with a bucket of
  superfluid, it reacts by forming vortices to exactly cancel the
  rotation of the bucket, thus preserving zero overall rotation.  The
  diagram and photographs below the video are from an experiment to
  see if that really is how it works.

<p>Look closely at the photographs.  The dots are the tops of little
  tornado-like vortices in the superfluid.  As the scientists
  increased the rotation speed of the bucket, new vortices appeared,
  one by one, and arranged themselves into a regular pattern.  Each
  vortex has exactly one ``quantum unit'' of spin.  The vortex cannot
  rotate any faster or any slower than this unit; the exact rotation
  rate is a fundamental constant of the universe.  If we spin the
  bucket faster, the superfluid simply makes more vortices.

<!-- 0.099693 square millimeters per second = h/m (m is mass of Helium atom) -->

<p>There is a deep analogy between these vortices and fundamental
  particles, such as electrons and quarks inside of atoms.  An
  electron contains exactly one quantum of electronic energy in the
  same way that a superfluid vortex contains one quantum of rotation.
  When enough energy is present, two electrons may spontaneously form,
  or three, but never two and a half, just like the vortices.
  Particles and superfluid vortices are closely related in quantum
  theory, so much so that studying one can teach us new things about
  the other.

<p>That's enough musing about cream in a coffee cup for now.

<p>This website is a blog about physics, about looking at things
  closely and seeing how they really are.  Sometimes, it will lead
  to surprising connections.  Unlike many blogs, the articles won't be
  rushed, and they will stay focused on the central theme.  I won't
  blog about what I eat for breakfast in the morning, unless of course
  that yields new insights into the cosmos.
