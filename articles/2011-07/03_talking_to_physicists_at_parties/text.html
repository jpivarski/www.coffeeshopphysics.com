<p>``So, what do you do?''

<p>``Me?  I'm a physicist.''

<p>``Hey, isn't that a coincidence?  I hated physics!''

<p>``Really?  Wow.''

<p>``I was so terrible at it in school, and my teachers were simply
  awful.  But you must be a genius!''

<p>``Um... actually...''

<p>``Oh, hi!  Nice to meet you.  A mathematician?  I was so bad at
  math...''

<p>That exact conversation is more common than you might think.  I'm
  sure that lawyers get evil-lawyer jokes and accountants get some
  variant of, ``Gee, that's boring,'' but physicists are told that
  their passion is dreadful in a way that's supposed to be a compliment.
  It would be easy to slip into the conceit that what we're doing is
  so esoteric and so painfully difficult that we are modern-day wizards, but that
  would be a lie.

<p>Physics isn't about out-of-this-world things like flux capacitors
  and trips across the eighth dimension: it's as
  in-this-world as you can get.  It's a fascination with all the
  little things that our world does, such as ice crystals growing on
  a spider web on a signpost (pictured above).  Imagine for the moment that
  you've been transported to a surreal world where everything
  works a little differently than you'd expect, or at least takes you
  by surprise.  At first, you can't help but notice the clam-flowers,
  circular rivers, and trees made from holes in the sky.  But if you
  spend a long time there, those idiosyncrasies could become the new
  normal: there's a danger of taking it for granted.

<p>Have you ever noticed rainbows in your icewater?  Or the musical
  chords an underpass makes when the wind blows through it?  Have you
  ever heard a staicy radio suddenly become clear when you touch it,
  and thought, ``Those radio waves are coming in through me!''
  There's nothing eccentric about turning the glass to see how the
  light goes through it, and it's not too weird to hold a cat up to
  the radio, just to see what will happen.  This is the essentially
  human act of doing physics: it's as natural and as relevant to our
  lives as the study of water would be to fish.

<p>Cutting-edge physics research in the seventeenth century was a lot
  like these examples: that's the time when research was just starting
  to be organized into controlled experiments.  This era conjures
  images of Galileo at the top of the Tower of Pisa, dropping two
  balls of different weights and saying, ``See?  I told you so!''
  Actually, he rolled the balls down inclined planes and repeated the
  experiment enough times to accumulate confidence.  As a stopwatch,
  he put water in an elevated bucket and let it pour out.  He and many
  other natural philosophers were building the methodological
  techniques that make results reliable, yet the impetus to do so was
  still based on this human curiosity about the world that we
  find ourselves dropped into.

<p>As the boundaries of the communal knowledge grew, the experiments
  became more intricate and the ideas about what they mean became more
  subtle.  At some point in the early twentieth century, the physics
  community broke off from the general intellectual community in the
  sense that non-physicists no longer believe that they know what
  physicists do.  It became magic.

<p>It's easy to see why: that was when physicists started making
  outrageous claims about basic philosophical concepts like space and
  time curving and bending, about objects existing and not existing
  simultaneously, and then backing up those claims with demonstrations
  like atomic bombs, lasers, and microelectronics.  Nevertheless, what
  physicists do today is fundamentally the same kind of activity as
  turning a glass of icewater to see where the rainbows come from.
  The world we were born into happens to be a strange one, but
  what might we have expected instead?

<p>The only real separation, then, between a physicist's knowledge
  about the universe and a layman's is depth.  That's okay: it's fine
  for a doctor's knowledge about bodies to be deeper than mine, but I
  still want to know a little about how my body works.  The idea that
  physicists can build huge instruments to study nature and then say,
  ``It's too complicated; you wouldn't understand," is like sailors
  mounting an expedition to new continents and returning only to say,
  ``You'd have to see it for yourself.''  I think it's part of a
  physicist's job to tell the wonders of yonder shores.

<p>This website is a personal account of what I've learned and what
  I'm learning about the idiosyncrasies of our world.  As a teenager,
  I read lots of popular books on relativity and quantum mechanics and
  was dying to find out about this stuff for myself.  What I found was
  more comprehensible and more amazing than they made it out to be.
  It's true that much of what I learned could only be fully
  communicated in the language of mathematics, and most people don't
  have the mathematical background to communicate that way, but what
  stuck with me the most in my travels were new metaphors and pictorial
  representations of the phenomena.  That's what I want to share with
  you.

<p>After all, even a formal mathematical model is a
  metaphor.  Some of its aspects communicate the
  truth of what it represents and others would be misleading if taken
  literally.  The classical mechanics I studied with such sweat and
  labor as an undergraduate communicates important truths about
  big things, but can't be taken literally at the quantum scale of
  atoms and electrons.  And even the most state-of-the-art model of
  microphysics, the Standard Model, is itself expected to be
  inapplicable at very small scales.

<p>The most important part of using
  metaphors, whether mathematical or whimsical, is knowing how they
  apply and how they don't.  As long as we do that, there's nothing
  disingenuous in me saying that nuclear fission reminds me of hard
  liquor.  It's just less detailed than a scholarly lecture would be.
