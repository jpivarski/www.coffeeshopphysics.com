<p>``The `burning' of uranium in an atomic furnace is so strange an
  affair that to get a picture of it at all we must overturn our
  familiar ideas about the behavior of fuel.''  This is the beginning
  of a 1952 <i>Scientific American</i> article on <i>Nuclear
  Chemistry</i> by John F. Flagg and Edwin L. Zebrowski.  ``Imagine a
  lump of coal in which only a tiny proportion of the lump (one part
  in 140) is combustible.  The combustible atoms are scattered all
  through the lump.  As each burns, it gives off sparks that ignite
  the others, and the burning proceeds by a chain reaction.  But the
  ashes of the burned atoms, deposited throughout the lump, soon begin
  to absorb some of the sparks and smother the fire.''

<p>Something about this metaphor seemed wrong to me when I read it.
  Perhaps I should call it an anti-metaphor because the point is how
  uranium is unlike coal.  I later came across the following quote
  from Ernst Rutherford, interviewed a year before nuclear chain
  reactions were first proposed.  He said, ``Anyone who expects a
  source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking
  moonshine.''

<p>That's exactly it!  Nuclear energy is just like moonshine!

<p>From a practical standpoint, the most important difference between
  chemical reactions, such as burning coal, and nuclear reactions is
  size.  The nucleus of an atom is about 100 thousand times smaller
  than the whole atom, so there is as much separation between what
  nuclei do and what atoms do as there is in a carnival of amoebas
  within a parade of dinosaurs.  When we put two chemicals together,
  the atoms touch and decide how to rearrange themselves, but the
  nuclei just so along for the ride.  Nuclei are hard to manipulate
  because even atom-sized fingers are too stubby.

<p>We might have never even learned about the existence of nuclei if they had not announced
  their presence with bright flashes of energy.  The spontaneous
  decay of an individual nucleus emits millions of times as much energy as
  an individual chemical reaction.  Tapping nuclei as a source of power
  was a popular idea--- among science fiction authors--- when
  Rutherford disparaged it in 1933.  Many of the imagined flights to
  the moon written in the 20's and 30's were launched by nuclear
  rockets.  Rutherford dismissed the idea because up to that time, the
  only way to coax nuclei to give up their energy was by needling them
  individually with neutrons or other particles.  Spilling
  individual drops of water of the Hoover Dam releases a lot of energy
  per drop, but not much energy overall.

<p>To get energy out of chemicals, we look for situations in which one
  kick starts an avalanche, so that the atoms themselves do most of
  the work.  Fire has traditionally been our favorite energy source
  because we only need to set a match to timber, or wick, or
  whale-oil, or coal, or gasoline, or biofuels to start a cascade of
  chemical reactions.  All of these fuels are chemicals that want to
  bind with the oxygen in the air to become carbon dioxide and ash or
  smoke.  They ``want'' this in the sense that it would lower their
  energy, but they can't do it on their own because the process
  itself costs energy.  We provide the kindling, a little energy in
  the form of heat, and the fuel reacts, producing more heat, causing
  more reactions, in a chain that either cooks our meat or burns down
  the village.

<p>The idea for nuclear chain reactions must have been inspired by the
  analogy with fire.  (Leó Szilárd, the inventor, said that he was
  inspired to prove Rutherford wrong.)  Nuclei, cocooned so deeply
  within their atoms, do not feel any heat whose temperature is less
  than that of the sun.  But uranium-235 nuclei have a clever
  alternative: shooting a neutron at a uranium-235 nucleus can cause
  the nucleus
  to split, and in the process of splitting, it releases 2--3 more
  neutrons.  If an average of one outgoing neutron strikes another
  unsplit uranium-235 nucleus, then the process will continue on its own, like
  wildfire.

<p>This is surprisingly difficult to do.  Today, almost 70 years after the
  first successful nuclear chain reaction, only four types of nuclei are known to be usable for energy
  production, and three of them are man-made.  Nature was
  extraordinarily kind to us, or unkind, depending on your point of
  view, in giving us the one: uranium.  Moreover, only 0.7% of natural
  uranium is combustable uranium-235, so chain reactions fizzle out because most
  of the neutrons miss their targets.  Without purification, the rock
  won't burn.

<p>This is how nuclear energy resembles moonshine.  Suppose that we're
  making liquor to fuel a car--- I think something like that happened
  in <i>The Dukes of Hazard.</i>  Alcohol can be found naturally in
  decaying fruit, but the concentration usually isn't high enough to
  burn in an automobile engine.  The combustible alcohol molecules are distributed uniformly
  in water (and other gunk) that absorbs the heat and stops the
  chain reaction.  But with a well-stocked outdoor shed, we can purify
  the alcohol by repeatedly separating the part with alcohol-like
  properties (low evaporation temperature) from the part with
  water-like properties.  At 180--190 proof, you're liable to blow
  the whole shed.

<p>Purifying uranium is much more difficult because the only
  difference between the combustible uranium-235 and the inert uranium-238 is
  that the latter is slightly heavier--- there are no chemical differences
  (like evaporation temperature) to use to separate them.  The best known way
  to do it is to dissolve the uranium in liquid and spin it in a
  centrifuge: the uranium-238 sinks slightly lower.  While it's
  spinning, you can cut it and put the lighter part in another
  centrifuge--- many, many times.  The difficulty of this procedure
  is what keeps most states from becoming nuclear states.

<p>How pure the uranium needs to be depends on what you're going to
  use it for.  To produce electricity, the natural 0.7% concentration
  needs to be increased to 3--5%.  To make a bomb, it needs to be
  at least 20%, but usually 80% or more.  Thus, it's much easier to
  make energy than to kill people, but anyone with enough centrifuges
  in their backyard has the option.

<p>When alcohol is burned, it becomes carbon dioxide and water.
  Enough water could suffocate the fire before all of the fuel is used
  up.  Nuclear reactions have the same kind of problem: the
  by-products of split uranium nuclei like to eat neutrons, which
  dampens and eventually stops the reaction before even 1% of the fuel
  is consumed--- most of the ``waste'' coming out of a reactor is
  actually fuel.  This was the subject of Flagg and Zebrowki's 1952
  article, and it is still true today: recycling could dramatically
  improve the efficiency and reduce the radioactivity of the waste.

<p>Nuclear recycling has had a rocky history because some of the
  by-products of the reaction (plutonium in particular) could be used
  to make bombs.  Even if the waste is left in a vault for ten
  thousand years, it will purify itself into ideal bomb-making
  material on its own, because combustible plutonium decays more
  slowly than inert plutonium.  Nuclear recycling was banned in some countries,
  such as the U.S., but it is practiced in a limited form in others.
  A main focus of future reactor designs is to find a way to recycle
  fuel more safely, more out of reach of nuclear terrorists.

<p>What astonishes me in all of this is how much the true difficulties with nuclear
  energy differ from what is often said of them.  For one thing,
  it is impossible for a commercial power plant to explode like a
  nuclear bomb--- its uranium-235 concentration is far too low---
  though it could explode like an old-fashioned steam engine, if the
  engineers are not careful.  That is, it could explode like a steam
  engine filled with radioactive chemicals.  And nuclear waste, far
  from its image as a nasty, useless toxin that no one wants, is
  dangerous because it is so valuable and useful to evil people.
