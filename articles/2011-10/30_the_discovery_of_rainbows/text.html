<p>I was stuck in traffic one day when a glorious double rainbow
  appeared over the highway.  It had been a drizzly day; the whole sky
  was covered with clouds except for a little gap along the horizon, and
  it was just about sunset.  As the sun slipped between the grey above
  and the ground below, the Chicago skyline was briefly golden with
  horizontal light, and two concentric rainbow rings encircled I-290
  like a kind of tunnel.

<p>Most of the rainbows I'd ever seen were faint wisps; this was an
  intense glow, as bright as a flask of electrified mercury.
  Fortunately, the cars weren't moving, so I got a good, long look.
  Rainbow-like color separation happens a lot in physics classes, and
  I thought I understood what caused the second rainbow.  I was wrong.
  I was thinking about first-order and second-order rainbows from
  diffraction gratings.  If the rainbows in the sky were due to the
  same mechanism, the second rainbow would have to be twice as big as
  the first (it isn't) and the colors would have to be in the same
  order (they aren't).  I stared at that second rainbow until the car
  behind me started beeping.  Were my eyes deceiving me?  Did the
  colors really go in the opposite order?

<p>When I got home, I read all about rainbows and how they work.  It's
  fascinating: the story of its discovery spans twenty centuries.

<p>The first part of the puzzle was solved by Aristotle (350 B.C.):
  why is the rainbow a bow?  For reasons that were understood a
  thousand years later, water droplets in clouds reflect light at
  specific angles, primarily 42 degrees, and to a lesser extent, 51
  degrees.  As I drove east on the highway, the last rays of the sun
  were shining behind me.  The rays that reflected off of the mist in
  front of me and into my eyes at a 42 degree angle collectively
  formed a circular ring.  Water droplets inside the ring or outside
  the ring reflected rays that missed my eyes, so I didn't see them.
  Half of this circular ring was underground, and the other half was
  the primary rainbow.  Secondary rainbows come from droplets that
  reflect at 51 degrees.

</div></div>

<p>If you try to reach a rainbow's end, to get the pot of gold,
  perhaps, the rainbow would move.  Different water droplets would
  reflect into your eyes so it would always seem to be the same
  distance, no matter where you go.  In fact, this is probably what
  inspired the pot of gold story: it seems just like a fairy's trick.

<p>Aristotle understood the geometry, but his explanation of the
  colors and their intensities was wrong
  (<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.3.iii.html#98">Meteorologica,
  book III</a>).  He noticed that the most intense color in both the
  primary and secondary rainbows is red, but thought that this had
  something to do with the way that fires are red and the sun looks
  red when it is close to the horizon.  Five centuries later,
  Alexander of Aphrodisias asked, ``If so, then why isn't the region
  between the two rainbows the brightest of all?  Instead, it's darker
  than both rainbows!''  (paraphrase,
  see <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kZcCtT1ZeaEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false">Lee
  and Fraser</a>).

</div></div>

<p>This prompted me to look at a lot of photographs of rainbows.  It's
  true: the band between the primary and secondary rainbow is often
  the darkest part of the sky.  The main optical phenomenon is not the
  narrow strip of colors, but the bright circular disk within 42
  degrees and the not-quite-as-bright annulus outside of 51 degrees.
  The colors are just a fringe that happen along the edges of these
  regions of light.  It's amazing how many paintings get this wrong.

<p>Rainbows continued to be the bleeding edge of scientific research
  through the middle ages, with many Islamic scholars and Christian
  monks contributing to the problem.  It often happens in science that
  the same discovery is made independently by two groups, simply
  because enough pieces of the solution are ``in the air.''  The idea
  of the Higgs boson, for instance, occured to three independent
  groups at the same time: it should be called a
  Higgs-Englert-Brout-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble boson.  The reason that
  water droplets reflect light within 42 degrees and outside of 51
  degrees was solved simultaneously by Persian scholar Kamāl al-Dīn
  Fārisī and Dominican monk Theodoric of Freiberg in the first decade
  of the fourteenth century.

<p>Fārisī and Theodoric both approached the problem with the
  combination of mathematical rigor and experimental honesty that
  defines modern science.  They both filled spherical balls with water
  to simulate a raindrop, measured angles of light entering and
  leaving the ball, and used these measurements to arrive at a correct
  geometrical interpretation of how light bounces around inside.
  However, there were errors in the details that weren't resolved
  until René Descartes <a href="http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/Descartes/meteores/meteores.html">solved the problem in 1637</a>.

<p>Descartes is my favorite philosopher-scientist.  He developed two
  of the most important tools in mathematics: the use of letters as
  variables (e.g. <i>y = x</i><sup>2</sup> instead of ``Consider a
  Quantitie, whose product of Itself with Itself is yet a seconde
  Quantitie, which will be determined forthwith...'') and analytic
  plotting.  Plotting turns abstract relationships into pictures---
  profoundly useful in both math and science.

<p>As in most fields, Descartes
  was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/227171">unaware of prior
  results about rainbows</a> and thought that he had invented it all
  himself.  In fact, just to solve this problem he derived the law of
  refraction, which describes how light bends (refracts) when it
  passes from air to water or any other transparent medium.  In the
  English-speaking world, we call this Snell's law, since Willebrord
  Snellius discovered it 16 years earlier.  In French, it's
  called <i>la loi de Descartes.</i>  It was originally discovered by
  Ibn Sahl of Baghdad in 984 A.D.

<p>Here's how rainbows work: when a ray of light enters a drop of
  water, it refracts at the air-water surface, part of it reflects
  inside the droplet, and then it refracts again on its way out.  It
  may reflect once, twice, or many times inside the droplet, but it
  loses intensity with each reflection because part of the light
  passes through the back of the droplet, rather than reflecting.  The
  inner disk of light (the primary rainbow) is due to one reflection
  and the outer annulus (the secondary rainbow) is due to two
  reflections.  It's hard to see rainbows from the third and fourth
  reflection because they come out of the back of the droplet, so
  you'd have to
  be <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111005111001.htm">looking
  toward the sun</a> to see them.

<p>The final angle of reflected light depends on where the incident
  light hits the droplet.  A light ray that hits the middle of the
  drop does not refract at all--- the water is simply a mirror.  Light
  rays hitting the top of the droplet have the most complex behavior.
  The plot below shows the relationship between the location of impact
  and the final angle.

<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="plot_of_angles.png" alt="Final angle versus impact point">
</div></div>

<p>As you can see, the one-reflection case has a maximum of 42 degrees
  and the two-reflections case has a minimum of 51 degrees.  They
  don't overlap, so there is a band of no light between them.  If the index
  of refraction of water had been 1.312, rather than 1.333, the
  primary and secondary rainbows would just barely touch each other,
  with no dark band.

<p>Rays of light are uniformly distributed along the droplet, but
  this leads to a non-uniform distribution of final angles.  I've
  tried to show that in the plot below: uniform slices of the
  horizontal axis project non-uniformly on the vertical axis.  Because
  the curve lingers at 42 degrees, there are more lines here than
  anywhere else.

<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="bunched_up_angles.png" alt="Same, but with lines connecting impact points to final angles">
</div></div>

<p>Taking this a step further, the plot below shows the intensity
  distribution of final angles.  Light rays pile up near 42 and 51
  degrees, producing the most intensity at these two angles.
  
<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="distribution_of_angles.png" alt="Intensity versus final angle">
</div></div>

<p>If we draw the intensity of each angle as a semicircle, it even
  begins to look like a double rainbow.

<div class="figure inline" style="clear: right"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="greybow.png" alt="Intensity as semicircles">
</div></div>

<p>Except for color.  Descartes's theory completely accounted for the
  angles of the rainbows, the dark band, and even the shape of the
  intensity distribution, but didn't have anything (correct) to say about color.
  That part of the problem was solved by Sir Isaac
  Newton <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GnAFAAAAQAAJ">67
  years later</a>.  Newton discovered that white light is not an
  indivisible entity but a mixture of all colors.  In his experiments
  with prisms, he found that each color of light refracts at a
  slightly different angle.

<p>As light enters and leaves a water droplet, red is refracted a
  little less than green, which is refracted a little less than blue.
  This pulls the light apart, especially at the extreme angles.  It
  also explains the color reversal in the outer rainbow: the second
  mirror reflection switches the order of the colors.

<p>The story doesn't completely end there: Thomas Young explained
  supernumerary rainbows (mini-rainbows just below the primary) with
  his <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/107135">discovery that
  light is a wave</a> (1804).  In the 1820's, Augustin-Jean Fresnel
  derived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">the
  equations</a> that determine how much light reflects off of the back
  of the water droplet and how much passes through.  There are even
  20<sup>th</sup> century developments
  in <a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v33/i16/p976_1">theory</a>
  and <a href="http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-15-11-2782">experiment</a>.

<p>However, the grand arc of the story begins with Aristotle and ends
  with Newton.  Few problems in physics have engrossed so many
  scientists for so many centuries.  It is a dramatic example of how
  science is cumulative: each discovery is only a part of a
  multigenerational quest.  In fact, Newton's famous quote about
  ``standing on the shoulders of giants'' was about this problem---
  the nature of white light and color separation in the rainbow.  He wrote,
<blockquote>
What Descartes did was a good step.  You [Hooke] have added much
several ways, &amp; especially in taking ye colours of thin plates
into philosophical consideration.  If I have seen further it is by
standing on ye shoulders of Giants.
<div style="text-align: right;">
Newton to Hooke, February 1676; <a href="http://www.isaacnewton.org.uk/books/CORRES">Corres</a> I, 416
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>I knew a physics major who used this when he failed a test.  ``If I
  have not seen as far as others,'' he said, ``it is because giants
  were standing on my shoulders.''
