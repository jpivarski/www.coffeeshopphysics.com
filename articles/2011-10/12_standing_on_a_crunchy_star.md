<p>A voyage to the sun would not be a pleasant trip.  While still a
  million miles away, the tungsten hull of our spacecraft
  would start to melt.  At half a million miles, it evaporates.  A
  little farther and we'd be nothing but swirling plasma, mixing into
  a nuclear furnace so vast that ``oceans'' would be an
  understatement.

<p>Though we could never touch the sun, there are stars that you can
touch--- former stars, anyway--- and one has recently been
discovered [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5201">link to
paper</a>].  It is only four thousand light-years away (16.1 years
traveler time; see ``<a href="../../../articles/2011-09/23_we_can_get_there_from_here/#distanceTable">We Can Get There from Here</a>'').  This star has
been transformed by its neighbor into a husk of cold diamond.  Since
it's solid, some astrophysicists are calling it a planet, but it's not
clear that the word applies to an object with such a bizarre history.

<p>Suppose that we take the 16-year trip to visit this world: what
would it look like?  Could we really stand on the heart of a dead
star?

<p>Stars are the universe's vocation: they finish the job that the Big
Bang started.  In the first minutes of cosmic expansion, the entire
universe was a burning plasma--- nuclear interactions were happening
everywhere, like the core of a star, but infinite in all directions.
It ended quickly, though.  As space expanded, this universe-filling
plasma cooled.  After about twenty minutes, all nuclear reactions had
ceased.

<p>In that first half-hour, most of the universe's helium was made.
  All of the matter in the universe was initially free protons and
  neutrons, but the extreme temperature allowed them to fuse into
  deuterium (one proton and one neutron), tritium (one proton, two
  neutrons), and helium (two protons, two neutrons).  The process
  would have continued, building more complex nuclei than helium, but
  the fire went out too soon.  If the universe had been expanding a
  little more slowly, it could have built lithium (three protons),
  beryllium (four protons), and so on, but as it was, only a tiny
  amount of lithium was made.

<p>After that, nothing.  It took another four hundred thousand years
for matter to cool enough to turn from a glowing plasma into an
invisible gas: space has been dark ever since.  For millions of years,
the hydrogen and helium (and smidgen of lithium) that were formed in
the Big Bang streamed into the darkness.  After at least a hundred
million years, gravity, the weakest of the fundamental forces, started
to gather matter into clouds.

<p>Gravitational accumulation is a run-away effect: as clouds get
  denser, their gravitational force gets stronger, so they get even
  more dense.  Eventually, gas was pouring into the gravitational
  wells so quickly that they were heated by their own pressure.  The
  gas became plasma, and the plasma started to burn: nuclear reactions
  began anew.  This time, the burning was limited to a few points of
  light in the sky, and was sustained.

<p>In these first stars, the process of building heavy elements from
light ones picked up where it had left off: free protons (hydrogen)
made more helium, hydrogen and helium combine to form lithium, helium
and helium make beryllium, and so on, building up all of the elements.
Since stars live for billions of years, they even produce nuclei with
hundreds of protons and neutrons.  We're made of heavy elements
(heavier than helium), so that's where we come from, the bellies of
stars.

<p>The energy released by these nuclear reactions counter-balance
gravity: as gravity pushes in, pressure pushes out.  Stars are a bit
like balloons--- the elastic surface of a balloon pushes against the
pressure of the air trapped inside.  A truce is established between
push and pull that keeps the balloon from shrinking or exploding.
Stars hold their form for a few billion years, but eventually the
outward pressure drops when it runs out of fuel.  They can go through
several stages of shrinking, creating higher pressures to unlock a new
reaction, burning that for a while, and shrinking again.  But there's
a limit.  Eventually they drop so deep that they hit a completely
different and unyielding source of pressure from quantum mechanics.
They bounce and burst.  These are novas and supernovas--- the
explosions that spewed most of the heavy elements into space--- that's
how we got out of the bellies of stars.

<p>What's left behind falls back down and comes to rest against the
hard wall of quantum mechanical pressure.  This quantum mechanical
pressure is completely unlike the pressure of a gas; it is due to the
mere fact that all electrons or neutrons are perfectly identical.
Pressure from burning fuel cannot last forever, but quantum mechanical
pressure does.  If the star has enough mass, it can become a black
hole, forever; if not, it will become a white dwarf (electron
pressure) or a neutron star (neutron pressure), and stay that way
forever.  The recently discovered ``diamond planet'' orbits a small
neutron star.

<p>The diamond planet is the result of an unusual situation.  A long
time ago, a pair of stars ended their lives as a neutron star and a
white dwarf.  They were very close, so close that the outer
atmospheres of the stars nearly touched, and the neutron star tore the
atmosphere off of the white dwarf.  Astrophysicists call these neutron
stars ``black widows.''  Usually, this would destroy the white dwarf,
but PSR J1719--1438 and PSR J1719--1438-b are an unusual pair.

<p>If the white dwarf was a carbon white dwarf, a class of stellar
remnants with a high concentration of heavy elements and a
particularly small mass, then it could have lost its atmosphere slowly
enough to form a heavy, carbon-rich core while drifting to a slightly
larger orbit, and thus escape complete destruction.  What has been
observed orbiting the neutron star is a small (Neptune-sized) object
which is extremely dense, <i>at least</i> 23 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.  That's
three times the density of iron, close to the density of iridium.  If
it really was a carbon white dwarf, then it would now be a
planet-sized diamond.

<p>That's interesting enough to warrant a trip.  What would we find
when we get there?

<p>The first thing we know about the system is that the neutron star
  is rapidly emitting radio pulses: that's how it was discovered.
  Each pulse comes from a revolution of the neutron star around its
  axis, the way that the Earth revolves around its axis once a day.
  However, the neutron star's days are very short--- pulses are 5.7
  milliseconds apart.  It sounds more like a buzzing than distinct
  clicks.

  sound like a 5.7 ms pulsar.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The radio signal is very weak when it reaches Earth, only
  2&#x00d7;10<sup>&#x2212;30</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup> Hz) of radio
  power.  Extrapolating from 4,000 light-years (Earth) to about 50
  thousand miles (the distance of the diamond planet from the neutron
  star), we get 400 W/m<sup>2</sup>, which is like standing a few feet
  from a strong FM broadcasting antenna.  We (and our electronics)
  could survive that, and most of the neutron star's radio power is
  directed in beams out of its north and south poles.  These beams
  might not even be pointing where we're standing.

<p>Neutron stars are famous for having extremely strong magnetic
  fields, though this one is relatively weak: at most 20 thousand
  Teslas (only 200 times the strongest field ever produced by humans).
  Moreover, these large numbers represent the magnetic field on
  the <i>surface</i> of the neutron star, and if we're investigating
  the diamond planet, we'll be thousands of miles away.  The magnetic
  field is hardly noticeable.

<p>Neutron stars don't shine because their nuclear reactions have long
  since extinguished.  However, the gas and dust spiraling into them
  gets very hot and bright due to friction, sometimes hot enough for
  nuclear reactions to flare up.  Unlike our sun, which only has
  nuclear reactions in its core, these reactions are not moderated by
  having to pass through thick layers of gas.  They would therefore be
  very energetic, with a lot more ultraviolet and X-rays than infrared
  (heat) and light.  The infalling gas may be clumpy, so the
  brightness could flare and fade like a bad candle.

<p>Six-day sequence showing a huge X-ray flare from a neutron star
  (<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/10feb_sgr/">SGR
  J1550-5418</a>, which is especially energetic).  As the X-rays
  propagate outward, they illuminate the surrounding dust clouds---
  that's why it looks like an expanding ring.  Smaller flares take
  only minutes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>No X-ray flares from the diamond planet's neutron star have been
  seen from Earth, so all we know is that it is less than 600 times as
  bright as the sun.  (From Earth, it would be a 25<sup>th</sup>
  magnitude star or dimmer.)  To be safe, though, we should bring
  strong visors.

<p>What about the diamond planet itself?  What would that be like?
  Its size is fairly well determined by its distance from the neutron
  star: it's about two-fifths the size of Jupiter, 20 thousand miles.
  Its mass is unknown, but at least the mass of Jupiter, a trillion
  trillion tons.  Putting these together, the surface gravity would be
  <i>at least</i> 15 times Earth's gravity.  That would be very
  uncomfortable, but not instantly fatal.

<p>In
  a <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980223621">NASA
  study from 1960</a>, humans were found to tolerate
  accelerations like 15g for a minute or longer:

<div class="figure inline"><div class="figurerow">
<img src="exerpt.png" alt="A 12g run for 1-minute was conducted by Ruff (ref. 6).  In this case the subject was in the prone position.  The original report by Ruff was not available; however, references to his work by other investigators would lead one to believe the subject was uninjured.">
</div></div>

<p>Above 12g, the subjects lost their vision (``they could only see
  dark clouds with stars, etc.'') and were only capable of ``simple
  manual switching operations using the hands and fingers.''  The best
  chance of surviving the visit would be on our backs in a stretcher,
  and the whole operation--- landing, collecting samples, and taking
  off again--- would have to be completed in a minute or less.
  Perhaps that is unrealistic.  Perhaps the surface would have to be
  explored by robots, while we watch from above.  They'll bring back
  samples.

<p>The second Lagrange orbit would be a comfortable place to sit and
  watch.  This orbit is just outside the planet's own orbit around the
  neutron star and takes just as long: 2 hours and 12 minutes.
  Since the planet would always be between us and the neutron
  star, it can protect us from unexpected X-ray flares.

</div></div>

<p>It may also be the most beautiful place in the universe.  Diamond
  is transparent: imagine what the neutron star would look like when
  eclipsed by a planet-sized gemstone.  The disk of gas swarming into
  the neutron star would look like a hurricane, with flashes of
  thermonuclear blasts searing the clouds like lightning.  All of this
  light would filter through the planet and around its edges,
  refracted into rainbows.

<p>Carbon white dwarfs are not pure carbon; a substantial fraction of
  the carbon nuclei combine with helium to make oxygen.  By the same
  argument that PSR J1719--1438-b is likely to be diamond, it is
  likely to contain a lot of crystallized oxygen as well.  When oxygen
  is solidified by high pressure, it turns orange, dark red, and
  metallic.  The planet might not be transparent after all, or it
  might have a translucent glaze along its surface, but a dark, ruddy
  interior.  Maybe something like this:

<p>If you've ever
  seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/"><i>2001, a Space
  Odyssey</i></a> (1968), have you noticed how pale and featureless
  the planets are?  Especially Jupiter--- several rounds of
  space-probes have revealed Jupiter to be vibrant with deep textures
  and rich contrasts, yet Kubrick's Jupiter looks like a cloudy day.
  Each generation of probes and telescopes unveils a universe more
  resplendent than the last, so whatever it is that's orbiting PSR
  J1719--1438, I'll bet it's far more awesome than we imagine.
