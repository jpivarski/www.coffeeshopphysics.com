<h3>Sun and Earth</h3>

<p>This is from the static electricity tutorial.  Since
  the force between oppositely charged particles and the force of
  gravity are similar (same distance dependence), the static
  electricity tools can be used to make planetary orbits.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>None.  Enjoy the show.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The documentation walks you through the process of building each of
  the tutorials and includes assets (graphics and GameObjects) for
  all of the demos.</p>
