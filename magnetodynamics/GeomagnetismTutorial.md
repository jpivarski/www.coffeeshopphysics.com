<p>This tutorial shows how to set up magnetic field lines and attach
them to an object, in this case, a rotating Earth.</p>

<p>This feature is the only one that requires an external package: <a href="http://starscenesoftware.com/vectrosity.html">Vectrosity by Starscene Software</a> (it draws the lines).  Without Vectrosity, everything except the field lines will work.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>None.  Enjoy the show.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The documentation walks you through the process of building each of
  the tutorials and includes assets (graphics and GameObjects) for
  all of the demos.</p>
