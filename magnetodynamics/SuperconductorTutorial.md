<h3>Hovering Magnet</h3>

<p>This one demonstrates superconductivity.  Superconductors expel
  magnetic fields from their bulk, which has a side effect of exerting
  an upward force on magnets.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>You can spin or bounce the magnet with the mouse.  If you push it
  too far, you'll see that the active part of the superconductor
  extends beyond its visual representation: superconductivity has only
  been implemented for an infinite plane and a sphere.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The documentation walks you through the process of building each of
  the tutorials and includes assets (graphics and GameObjects) for
  all of the demos.</p>
