<h3>Ball Magnets</h3>

<p>This is a completed version of the first tutorial in the
  documentation.  As an end-user, you can build demos like this
  pretty easily.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>Move any of the ball magnets and they will try to
  rearrange themselves to minimize their total energy.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The documentation walks you through the process of building each of
  the tutorials and includes assets (graphics and GameObjects) for
  all of the demos.</p>
