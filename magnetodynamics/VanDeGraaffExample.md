<h3>Van de Graaff Example</h3>

<p>This one demonstrates the static electricity simulation: balloons,
  particles, a ball bearing, and staticy fabric are attracted to the
  Van de Graaff generator when it's on.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>You can turn the Van de Graaff generator on and off by pressing its
red button.  If the charged ball bearing and the particle accelerator
are visible, you can move them, too.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>Magnetodynamics contains tools for simulating magnets and static
electricity.  The magnetic and electric fields are not coupled
(Amp&#232;re's law and Faraday's law), since that would be
computationally expensive.  The goal of this project is to emulate the
effects that are large enough to be easily noticed by humans, such as
static cling.  See the documentation for details.</p>
