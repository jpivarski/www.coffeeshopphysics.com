<h3>Antimatter in a Penning Trap</h3>

<p>This demonstrates the plasma simulation by holding a whiff of
  antimatter in a Penning trap.  A Penning trap is a configuration of
  magnetic and electric fields (magnetic solenoid and electric
  quadrupole) that contain a cloud of charged particles without
  letting them touch the walls.  Antimatter is often stored this way
  for experiments.</p>

<h4>Interactivity</h4>

<p>You can rotate the camera left and right with the mouse.  See how
  the antimatter flattens and rotates like a little galaxy?</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The documentation walks you through the process of building each of
  the tutorials and includes assets (graphics and GameObjects) for
  all of the demos.</p>
