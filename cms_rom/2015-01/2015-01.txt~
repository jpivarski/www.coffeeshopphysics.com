Title: One measurement, many implications

Four months ago, I wrote about a CMS measurement that had implications for three distinct theories of new physics. I spoke too soon â€” a new one constrains seven.

In this new result, CMS scientists identified proton collisions that result in two jets and, assuming that these jets were the only products of a single-particle decay, computed the mass of that particle. In most cases, the two jets don't really come from a particle with a well-defined mass, so this interpretation produces a smooth distribution of masses.

Many theories of new physics predict new kinds of particles, and many of them would decay into pairs of jets. If one of these new particles exists, it would show up in the two jet mass plot as a narrow peak at a single mass on top of the smooth distribution. In a recent paper, CMS scientists extended the search for peaks up to 5 TeV. Since they didn't see any, they systematically excluded theoretical models within that mass range.

I have oversimplified the search procedure: The scientists used additional tools, such as identification of jets derived from b quarks, and tuned the search for special cases, such as wide jets.  This paper actually represents a constellation of new physics searches, all based on the theme of peaks in the two jet mass distribution.

In rapid succession, the models are: (1) Resonances from string theory, on the assumption that the energy scale for quantum gravity is much lower than it appears to be; (2) Scalar diquarks from grand unified theories; (3) Excited quarks from substructure within the quark, including excited b quarks; (4) Axigluons and colorons, which would be heavy cousins of gluons in an extension of the string force; (5) W' and Z', which would be heavy cousins of the W and Z of the weak force; (6) Randall-Sundrum gravitons, gravitons oscillating between two string-theory branes in a highly curved space; and (7) quantum black holes.
